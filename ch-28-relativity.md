# Special Relativity

## Introduction

We are now moving into the area of &quot;modern physics&quot; in the textbook. Historically, &quot;classical physics&quot; ended around 1900. In the last decades of the 1800&#39;s physicists were starting to explore phenomena that could not be explained by the equations of classical physics. This included how atoms emit and absorb light, how solids emit light, the structure of the atom, how light causes electrons to be ejected from a metal, and radioactivity. In addition, in 1905 Einstein gave the world a new set of equations of motion that must be used for objects that are moving at high speed.

This chapter (Special Relativity) covers the laws of physics when there is no acceleration. About 10 years after Einstein developed Special Relativity he developed General Relativity which covers accelerating objects and gravity.

### Topics

- TBA

### Terms to Know

- inertial reference frame, postulate, simultaneity, time dilation, proper time, length contraction, proper length
- velocity addition, relativistic momentum, energy, KE, rest energy

## 28.1 Einstein&#39;s Postulates

### To Do

-

- State and explain both of Einstein&#39;s postulates.
- Explain what an inertial frame of reference is.
- Describe one way the speed of light can be changed.

### Notes

Q1. What is an inertial reference frame?

Write out the two postulates of Special Relativity.

1.

2.

Postulate 1 is also known as the principle of Galilean relativity. It is a postulate that was accepted by classical physicists.

Not in the textbook: What is the &quot;luminiferous aether?&quot;   Who failed to detect it in 1887?

## 28.2 Simultaneity And Time Dilation

### To Do

-

- Describe simultaneity.
- Describe and calculate time dilation.
- Calculate γ.
- Compare proper time and the observer&#39;s measured time.
- Explain why the twin paradox is a false paradox.

### Notes

Do observers in different inertial reference frames agree concerning simultaneous events?

What questions do you have on the thought experiment involving two flash lamps and the moving train car?

What is a gedanken experiment?

Einstein quote: &quot;When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come close to the conclusion that the gift of imagination has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing absolute knowledge.&quot;

TIME DILATION
Write the book&#39;s definition of time dilation.

Another description of time dilation is:  Moving clocks run slow.

Q2. Figure 28.6  You should imagine that the observer on Earth is holding an identical light clock to the one in the spacecraft. For the clock of the observer on Earth the light travels a distance &quot;2D&quot; as the light goes up to the top mirror an returns to the bottom of the clock. Why does it take longer for the light beam to travel on the path &quot;2s&quot; than on the path &quot;2D&quot;?

What is proper time?

The clock in your hand measures proper time.

We may derive the equation for time dilation in class.

Q3. How are elapsed time on a clock and time intervals between ticks of a clock related?

How is gamma calculated and used?      gamma,  γ  = 1 / sqrt( 1 – v2/c2 )

Calculate gamma for the cases of v = 0.01c      v = 0.1c    v = .8c  and v = .99c

Why would the GPS system have to take the effects of Special Relativity into account?

The Twin Paradox

What questions do you have on the Twin Paradox?

## 28.3 Length Contraction

### To Do

-

- Describe proper length.
- Calculate length contraction.
- Explain why we don&#39;t notice these effects at everyday scales.

### Notes

Q4. What is a proper length?

What is length contraction?

L = Lo / gamma

Has Special Relativity been confirmed by experiments or measurements?  Describe one.

What questions do you have on the examples worked out in the textbook?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. A reference frame is a set of X and Y axes in which we can make measurements. An inertial reference frame has constant velocity (speed and direction).

Q2. The speed of light is a constant for both clocks. The path 2S is longer than the path 2D so it takes longer for the light to return to the bottom of the clock that is moving.

Q3. If the elapsed time between ticks is greater the clock will run slower. You can convince your self of this by saying &quot;tick tock tick tock …&quot; and moving your hand like a second hand at every tick. Change the rate at which you say tick tock and note the change in the angular motion of your hand.

Q4. The length of some object at rest with respect to you has proper length.

## 28.4 Relativistic Addition of Velocities

### To Do

-

- Calculate relativistic velocity addition.
- Explain when relativistic velocity addition should be used instead of classical addition of velocities.

### Notes

Classical Addition

What questions do you have on classical addition?

Relativistic Velocity Addition

Suppose a rocket traveling at 0.5c fires a missile ahead of the rocket. The missile leaves the rocket at 0.7c with respect to the rocket.

Q1. Why is the speed of the missile not 1.2c?

Special Relativity provides a way to add velocities and avoid arriving at a result faster than the speed of light.

U = (V + U&#39;) / (1 + (V \* U&#39;)/c2 )

V is the relative velocity between the two observers. U&#39; is the velocity relative to the moving observer.

You should do this calculation with U&#39; = c.

## 28.5 Relativistic Momentum

### To Do

-

- Explain why the only mass it makes sense to talk about is rest mass.

### Notes

Conservation of momentum is a fundamental law of physics. In order to conserve momentum at high speeds an adjustment, by gamma, has to be made to the momentum of the moving objects. The relativistic momentum is larger than the classical value of momentum by the factor of gamma.

The mass of the object does not actually increase. Instead it behaves as if it has more mass in momentum and kinetic energy calculations.

## 28.6 Relativistic Energy

### To Do

-

- Compute the total energy of a relativistic object.
- Compute the kinetic energy of a relativistic object.
- Describe rest energy, and explain how it can be converted

### Notes

Energy is conserved in Special Relativity.

Total Energy and Rest Energy

Total Energy   E = γ m c2         m is the mass of the object at rest, the only mass we will use.

If the speed is zero the object still has energy, a rest energy, E0 = mc2 .

Q2. What happened to the gamma symbol?????

Note that this equation tells us that mass is related to energy. This has been confirmed in nuclear fission and fusion experiments.

Kinetic Energy and the Ultimate Speed Limit

When work is done on an object its kinetic energy increases (assuming no change in potential energy).

Work = KE       Work = E – E0      Work = (γ – 1) m c2      or      KE =  (γ – 1) m c2

This is a more accurate calculation for KE than ½ m V2 .

Write your own summary of why no object can have a speed equal to the speed of light.

How can sunlight be used to propel a spacecraft through the solar system?  Your explanation should not refer to sunlight making electricity or sunlight generating some chemical reaction that would fuel a rocket.

CORRESPONDENCE PRINCIPLE

Q3. What is the correspondence principle?  How does this principle help us understand the historical development of our understanding of the universe?

What questions do you have on the examples worked out in the textbook?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Nothing can travel faster than light, 1c .

Q2. Gamma has a value of 1 when V is zero.

Q3. The equations of Special Relativity agree with (&quot;correspond to&quot;) the classical equations for low speeds. Older physics discoveries used older technology that did not reveal more extreme physical situations.
