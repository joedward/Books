# Introduction

These chapter notes are based on the hard work of Greg Clements. I have rearranged some aspects of the notes; also, I am in the process of converting the math markup to a format that is viewable in a browser, and I am adjusting the content to fit my classes. Nevertheless, the great bulk of credit goes to the original author.

Please be aware that adapting these notes is an ongoing endeavor, and so there will be parts of the notes that are garbled or seem out of place or simply don't fit in with what we do in class. I offer my apologies to you, and I am glad to accept alerts and criticisms from you to expedite this conversion process.
