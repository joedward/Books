# Ch 25: Optics-1

## Geometric Optics

### Introduction

This chapter will discuss applications of light for which the light can be considered to be traveling in a straight line except when it reflects \(e.g. off a mirror\) or refracts \(e.g. its path is bent as it passes from air into water\). This occurs as long as the light encounters objects that are very large compared to the wavelength of the light. Can you draw the wave for visible light on this page with the proper distance between the peaks of the wave? Why or why not?

Chapter 27 will discuss applications where light energy is spread out when the light moves through a small opening.

### 25.1 The Ray Aspect of Light

#### To Do

* List the ways by which light travels from a source to another location.

#### Notes

Q1. What is a ray?

The "ray" model is a convenience that allows us to more quickly analyze how light energy moves as it encounters mirrors and lenses. It is important that you remember that light is actually a wave.

If there is no material between the source and the screen where the ray hits, the ray travels in a straight line. If there is a mirror or lens between the source and some screen the ray will likely change directions before it reaches the screen.

### 25.2 The Law of Reflection

#### To Do

* Explain reflection of light from polished and rough surfaces.

#### Notes

Reflection is a common process for rays of light. The law of reflection applies to one thin ray as it reflects from a surface.

Q2. What is a normal? Where is it drawn in a diagram and how is it oriented with respect to the surface? It is important to note that every ray has its own normal.

The Law of Reflection describes how a ray leaves a surface after reflecting.

```text
θi =   θr      These are the angles for the incident ( i ) ray and reflected ( r ) rays. By convention (tradition) the angle is measured from the normal to the ray. A ray that is approaching a surface directly will have a small angle. A ray that is just grazing a surface will have a large angle.
```

A beam of light consists of a multitude of rays. There is a difference in the outcome if a beam of light reflects off of a smooth or rough surface. Each ray in the beam has its own normal.

Mirrors will be curved in a later section but the rays will still individually obey the principles given in this section.

Specular reflection occurs when a beam of light reflects from a smooth surface. The smooth surface may be curved. What objects in our class room exhibit specular reflection?

Diffuse reflection occurs when a beam of light reflects from a rough surface. What objects in our class room exhibit diffuse reflection?

What is the cause of the difference between specular and diffuse reflection?

Q3. What is an image?

An image is found by tracing rays from one spot on the object to the place where the rays \(or extensions of reflected or refracted rays\) cross. We will get practice with this when we locate images formed by refraction and reflection.

### 25.3 The Law of Refraction

#### To Do

* Determine the index of refraction, given the speed of light in a medium.
* . Understand and Apply Snell's Law

#### Notes

Refraction occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media. The speed of light is only equal to 3 x 108 m/s in a vacuum.

There was a time when it was believed that light traveled infinitely fast. Measurements by Roemer in the late 1600's showed this was not true. The "clock" of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter runs fast and slow in a predictable way based on the extra distance the light has to travel to the Earth as the Earth orbits the Sun.

By the late 1800's the speed of light through air was measured with great precision. Later the speed of light was measured as the light traveled through various gases, liquids, and transparent solids \(e.g. glass\).

Light has its greatest speed when it travels through a vacuum. The speed of light is slower in gases, liquids, and solids. The index of refraction is a measure of how much the speed of light decreases in these materials.

n = c / v n is the index of refraction \(not an integer\), v is the speed of light in the material

```text
            We will use 3 x 108 for the value of the speed of light.
```

For the table listed in the textbook, what material has the highest index of refraction?

Imagine a marching band that starts on pavement and then moves into a muddy field. Imagine that the band is not marching directly into the field but is entering at an angle \(like the lawn mower in the figure in the textbook\). The band members who reach the muddy field first will not be able to step as far on each stride as the members who are still on the pavement. This will cause the whole band to change direction as the band continues into the muddy field. You should make a little sketch of this with dots for each member of the band. Make each row of dots a certain distance apart while on the pavement. Imagine the band moving forward and put a new row of dots in the direction the band is marching. Reduce the distance to the dots as the band enters the muddy field.

The band members are likely taking a step with every major beat of the drum line. The marching frequency is constant. The same thing occurs with light. The frequency of the light is the same in a vacuum and in some medium \(e.g. air, water, glass\). The speed of light is reduced in the medium and the wavelength of the light is reduced in the medium. For all waves: v = λf

Snell's Law describes the relationship between the index of refraction and angle of the ray away from the normal. The normal is perpendicular to the surface at the point where the ray hits. For refraction the normal is drawn on both sides of the boundary between the two media. If the ray is traveling directly down the normal the angle is zero. If the ray is grazing the boundary between the two media the angle is 90o.

Snell's Law n1 \* sin θ1 = n2 \* sin θ2

Q4. When you view an object in water, why does the object appear to be closer to the surface of water than it actually is?

### 25.4 Total Internal Reflection

#### To Do

25.4. Total Internal Reflection

* Explain the phenomenon of total internal reflection.
* Describe the workings and uses of fiber optics.
* Analyze corner reflectors and the reason for the sparkle of diamonds.

#### Notes

This effect occurs when the ray starts in the medium with the larger index of refraction.

What is the largest number that can be successfully processed by the inverse sine function? Try taking inverse sine of these values with your calculator: 0.4, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1 .

Suppose a ray of light starts in medium 1 and hits the boundary with medium 2. Solve Snell's law for θ2.using only symbols, not numbers. This will require you to take the inverse sine as a final step.

θ2 =

The value of θ1 that produces θ2 = 90o is called the critical angle, θC .. If θ1 is larger than θC then total internal reflection occurs. If the boundary does not have irregularities, 100% of the energy of the light is reflected.

Q5. Under what circumstances can total internal reflection occur?

What questions do you have on fiber optics? List some applications of fiber optics.

Corner Reflectors and Diamonds

Is it possible to construct a mirror system with flat mirrors that will cause the reflected ray to be parallel \(but going in the opposite direction\) to the incoming ray? Hint: What safety device is attached to the spokes of a bicycle wheel to help car drivers see bicycles at night?

How do astronomers know that the Moon is moving farther away from the Earth every year? AND, how many optical devices on the Moon can be used for this measurement?

The Sparkle of Diamonds

Why does light have trouble getting out of a diamond?

We will discuss dispersion in the next section.

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. A ray is a straight line that indicates the direction the energy of the light is moving. The ray will change direction if it encounters a mirror or lens. A light bulb has rays that move outward in all directions. A laser has one ray direction. A rough object \(not a mirror\) that is reflecting light will have rays moving outward in all directions.

Q2. The normal is a line drawn perpendicular to the surface at the point where a ray hits the surface.

Q3. An image is produced by reflection or refraction \(lenses\) of light from an object. The image may be the same size or larger or smaller. The image may have the same orientation as the object or be inverted \(upside down\) or reversed \(left to right\). We will learn how to determine the nature of the image as we study different types of mirrors and lenses.

Q4. You should draw a fish under a layer of water that has a smooth surface \(no waves\). Roughly trace two rays from the front of the fish towards the air and out into the air. Since the index of refraction is smaller for air than for water, the angle of a ray in air is larger than the angle of a ray in water. Now, extend the rays that are in air back into the water until the two rays cross. This gives the location of the image of the fish.

Q5. The ray needs to start in the medium that has the higher index of refraction. The angle of the starting ray has to be relatively large.

Why does white light create colors when the light passes through a prism?

### 25.5 Dispersion: The Rainbow and Prisms

#### To Do

* Explain the phenomenon of dispersion and discuss its advantages and disadvantages.

#### Notes

ROYGBV Know these colors in the visible spectrum in order. Red has the longest wavelength and smallest frequency of these colors.

Q1. What causes dispersion?

List the three optical steps that light undergoes when a rainbow is produced.

Suppose you see a rainbow towards the eastern horizon. Where is the Sun in the sky?

Q2. TRUE or FALSE Dispersion occurs when light reflects off of a surface.

Suppose these two types of glass exist:

Glass A has index of refraction values 1.555 for blue, 1.553 for red.

Glass B has index of refraction values 1.578 for blue, 1.560 for red.

Which glass will produce the largest dispersion effect? \(i.e. best separation of colors\)

### 25.6 Image Formation by Lenses

#### To Do

* List the rules for ray tracing for thin lenses.
* Illustrate the formation of images using the technique of ray tracing.
* Determine power of a lens given the focal length.
* Calculate the location of an image
* Calculate the magnification value for a lens
* Perform ray tracing and calculations when two lenses are used to produce an image

#### Notes

We will find image locations using ray tracing and calculations. The ray tracing techniques and equations apply best when the thickness of the lens is small compared to the diameter of the lens. Unless you are told otherwise we will assume the lenses meet this condition. We will not consider dispersion for these thin lenses.

The optic axis passes through the center of the lens and is perpendicular to the cross sectional area of the lens. Figure 25.27 shows a thicker lens than we will use. I may do ray tracing by refracting the ray when it is at the center of the lens.

If a light ray is parallel to the optic axis of a converging lens it will be refracted by the lens through the focal point of the lens on the opposite side of the lens from where the light entered the lens. The focal length, f, is the distance from the center of the lens to the focal point. Light from a very distant source will be parallel to the optic axis. A lens has a focal point on each side of the lens. The values for f are the same for both sides of the lens.

The "power" of a lens is measured in diopters P = 1/f f is measured in meters. If you have your eyes checked and need corrective lenses you will see diopter numbers written for the prescription. Why did I put quotes around the word "power."

How is the focal point for a diverging lens found?

Note that f is positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens.

Q3. What is the difference in appearance for converging and diverging lenses?

You must memorize the rules for ray tracing for converging lenses:

1. An incoming ray parallel to the optic axis is refracted through the focal point
2. An incoming ray that passes through the focus exits the lens parallel to the optic axis
3. An incoming ray that passes through the center of the lens continues in a straight line.

There are some simple modifications of these rules for diverging lenses.

Image Formation by Thin Lenses

Objects send out light in all directions. You will need to trace two rays from the object to locate the image. Typically we just locate the image for the top of the object. We don't do ray tracing for every point on the object. When two rays from the object cross we have located the image.

A real image is a location where there is actual concentration of energy. A camera will record an image if it is placed at the location of a real image.

A virtual image is a location where there is not an actual concentration of energy \(e.g. the image you see in a mirror is a virtual image\). A camera will not record an image if it is placed at the location of a virtual image.

Thin Lens Calculations di is the distance from the center of the lens to the image

1 1 1 do is the distance from the center of the lens to the object

---- + ---- = -----

di do f

You must memorize the sign conventions for f, di, and do for lenses.

m = - di/do = hi/ho magnification The sign of the magnification is associated with the orientation of the image. If the magnification for a single lens is negative the image is inverted.

hi is the height of the image ho is the height of the object.

Q4. TRUE or FALSE A diverging lens can be used as a simple magnifier.

Where does the object have to be located for a lens to act as a simple magnifier? Give a general description of the location.

What questions do you have on the problem solving method for lenses?

You should be able to do calculations and ray tracings to find an image in situations which involve one or two converging or diverging lenses.

The image formed by the first lens is the object for the second lens. You must determine the object distance for the second lens. You must determine if the object distance for the second lens is a positive or negative number.

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. The value of the index of refraction has a slight dependence on the frequency of the light. In general, the index of refraction is highest for violet light and smallest for red light. The angle of the refracted ray calculated using Snell's Law depends on the index of refraction.

Q2. FALSE The value of the reflected angle is equal to the value of the incident angle. The reflected angle does not depend on the frequency of the light.

Q3. A converging lens is thicker at the center than at the edge. A diverging lens is thinner at the center than at the edge.

Q4. False Only converging lenses act as simple magnifiers.

### 25.7 Image Formation by Mirrors

#### To Do

* Illustrate image formation in a flat mirror.
* Explain with ray diagrams the formation of an image using spherical mirrors.
* Determine focal length and magnification given radius of curvature, distance of object and image.

#### Notes

Know how to trace rays to find the image location for a plane mirror.

Is it possible to construct a mirror system with flat mirrors that will cause the reflected ray to be parallel \(but going in the opposite direction\) to the incoming ray? Hint: What safety device is attached to the spokes of a bicycle wheel to help car drivers see bicycles at night? \(Corner reflector\)

Know how to find all image locations for mirrors that join at a right angle.

The ray tracing and calculations will be easy as they are similar to the lens problems.

Q1. Why do rays that approach a curved mirror parallel to each other not leave the mirror parallel to each other?

The mirror has an optic axis that is drawn perpendicular to the cross sectional area of the mirror. The optic axis hits the center of the mirror.

Q2. Where is the zero location for position measurements for mirrors?

For the simple, spherical mirrors we will analyze, the focal length has a value equal to half the radius value. f = R/2

Know how to draw and do ray tracing for a concave and a convex mirror.

You must memorize the rules for ray tracing for concave mirrors:

1. An incoming ray parallel to the optic axis is reflected through the focal point
2. An incoming ray that passes through the focus exits the mirror parallel to the optic axis
3. An incoming ray that passes through the center of curvature reflects back on itself.

There are some simple modifications of these rules for convex mirrors.

1 1 1

---- + ---- = ----- m = - di/do magnification What is the significance of the sign?

di do f

You must memorize the sign conventions for f, di, and do for mirrors.

The concave mirror has a positive focal length. The center of the concave mirror is farther from the object that the edge of the mirror. The convex mirror has a negative focal length. The center of the mirror is closer to the object than the edge of the mirror. In some ways, the concave mirror acts like the converging lens and the convex mirror acts like the diverging lens.

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. Rays at different distances from the optic axis strike the mirror at different locations. The direction of the normal for each different ray has a different direction compared to another normal.

Q2. At the center of the mirror where the optic axis hits the mirror.
