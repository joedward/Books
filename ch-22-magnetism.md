## Magnetism

### Introduction

There is a very close relation between electricity and magnetism. The understanding of electric and magnetic effects developed throughout the 1800's. The two effects were firmly linked together in the late 1860's by Maxwell when he described light as a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. You should definitely read the introduction to this chapter in the OpenStax Physics textbook.

#### Topics

* Hall Effect, magnetic force, magnetic torque

### 22.1 Magnets

#### To Do

-

* Describe the difference between the north and south poles of a magnet.
* Describe how magnetic poles interact with each other.

#### Notes

There are similarities between magnetism and electricity. Magnets can attract or repel, and there are two labels for magnets, north seeking and south seeking poles \(similar to + and – charges\). But there are important differences as well. We can isolate a proton or electron but no one has ever observed an isolated north magnetic pole nor an isolated south magnetic pole. There are some theories that say magnetic monopoles should exist but they have never been observed. Magnets from large size to atom size all have a north and south magnetic "pole."

How many "poles" does a permanent magnet have?

Q1. What happens when a bar magnet is cut in half?

Q2. TRUE or FALSE The magnetic force is due to isolated magnetic "charges" that we call North and South poles.

The Earth's magnetic field is similar to the magnetic field from a bar magnet. BUT there is no permanent magnet in the core of the Earth. The magnetic field of the Earth acts as though a south magnetic pole was near the north geographic pole of the Earth. We will discuss the best theory for the source of the Earth's magnetic field later.

How does a traditional compass needle indicate the direction of the magnetic field?

Is the magnetic field of the earth similar in pattern to the magnetic field of a bar magnet?

How does the position of the earth's north magnetic pole compare to the position of the north geographic pole?

Why is it unlikely that at large bar magnet in the interior of the earth is responsible for the earth's magnetic field?

### 22.2 Ferromagnets and Electromagnets

#### To Do

* Define ferromagnet.
* Describe the role of magnetic domains in magnetization.
* Explain the significance of the Curie temperature.
* Describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.

#### Notes

What is ferromagnetic material?

It turns out that there are two sources for magnetic fields. One source is a current \(moving charges\) in devices known as electromagnets. The other source is the "spin" of electrons.

Q3. What is a magnetic domain? \(Be sure to read the answer.\)

The text has a nice side by side photo of a coil of wire carrying current and a bar magnet. The iron filings line up with the magnetic field for each object and show us that the two effects generate very similar magnetic fields.

The alignment of the electron spins can be disrupted by knocking or bumping the atoms into one another. When the atoms bump the electron orientation is disturbed. One way to increase the bumping is to raise the temperature of the permanent magnet. At a temperature above the Curie Temperature a permanent magnet will lose its magnetism. Also, if you want to keep your permanent magnet in top form do not drop it or hit it on any object. A collision will bump the atoms in the domains and weaken the permanent magnet.

Do you think a permanent magnet would survive if it was inside a pie in an oven?

Current \(2015\) computer hard drives use magnetism to record 0's and 1's. However it may not be too long before solid state drives replace magnetic hard drives. The solid state drives don't have moving parts that wear out \(but backups will still be recommended\).

Current: The Source of All Magnetism

I have already commented on this topic.

### 22.3 Magnetic Fields and Magnetic Field Lines

#### To Do

* Define magnetic field and describe the magnetic field lines of various magnetic fields.

#### Notes

The concept of magnetic field is used to help use calculate magnetic force. We used a similar approach when we used electric field to calculate the value of electric force.

Comment on Figure 22.16 You will use a Right Hand Rule to determine the direction of magnetic field due to a current in a wire. Place the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the conventional current. Wrap your fingers around the wire. Your fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field. We will use the Right Hand Rule to help us discover the direction of magnetic force in place of vector calculations. \(Our textbook calls this Right Hand Rule \#2 and discusses it later in the chapter.\)

You should memorize the four properties of magnetic field lines that are stated in our textbook. Property 4 is much different than the electric field lines. Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges.

Q4. Why don't magnetic field lines start on north poles and end on south poles?

### 22.4 Magnetic Field Strength: Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field

#### To Do

* Describe the effects of magnetic fields on moving charges.
* Use the right hand rule 1 to determine the velocity of a charge, the direction of the magnetic field, and the direction of the magnetic force
* on a moving charge.
* Calculate the magnetic force on a moving charge.

#### Notes

A charge that is moving in the presence of a magnetic field will experience a force.

```text
    F = qvB sinθ        θ is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field.

                    The standard metric unit for B is the Tesla. 1 Tesla is a large magnetic field.
```

Know the right hand rule for determining the direction of F. I prefer a different description of the right hand rule than what is shown in our textbook. You can use either method as long as you get the right answer for the direction!

1. Extend the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the velocity.
2. Rotate your wrist so it is easy to bend your fingers into the direction of the magnetic frield.
3. If q is positive your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic force.

   If q is negative the force is in the opposite direction to your thumb.

It is important to note that the force is perpendicular to both the velocity and to the magnetic field.

Q5. TRUE or FALSE A proton is moving at a speed of 700 m/s parallel to a magnetic field that has a strength of 0.04 Teslas. The magnetic force is zero.

What angle between the velocity and magnetic field gives the largest force?

### 22.5 Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field: Examples and Applications

#### To Do

* Describe the effects of a magnetic field on a moving charge.
* Calculate the radius of curvature of the path of a charge that is moving in a magnetic field.

#### Notes

Dig back through the physics knowledge in your subconscious. What topic in the first semester had a force perpendicular to the velocity?................................... Right! Circular Motion.

As illustrated in Figure 22.20 we will use situations where the magnetic field has the same direction and same strength over an extended area. The magnetic force creates a centripetal force on the moving charge. FC = mv2/r r is the radius of the path of the charged particle.

Since the magnetic force is supplying the centripetal force: qvB sinθ = mv2/r

```text
    For most of our problems sinθ = 1   so   qvB = mv2/r     or                      r = mv/(qB)
```

If the charge has a component of its velocity parallel to B the charge will move in a helix \(book calls this a spiral\).

The book discusses how a magnet can be damaging to an old-fashioned TV screen such as in Figure 22.21 \(TV sets with cathode ray tubes instead of LCD screens\). The magnet is not changing the properties of the glass. The magnetic field penetrates the glass and magnetizes the iron screen inside the glass tube. With the external magnet removed the magnetic field due to the magnetized iron screen affects the path of the electrons coming towards the phosphor at the front of the tube and the image is distorted. Don't try this at home if you have an older TV that is not a flat screen TV, as it will permanently magnetize the iron screen near the front of the cathode ray tube and ruin the TV.

The Earth's magnetic field is important as a line of defense against radiation entering the Earth's atmosphere. It also plays a major role in forming the beautiful aurora displays. The Van Allen radiation belts are an important part of the space environment near Earth.

Mass spectrometers are discussed in the next reading guide.

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. You will then have two shorter magnets. Each of the new magnets will have a south and north pole.

Q2. False The poles of a magnet are concentrated regions where the magnetic effect is strong but there are no magnetic monopoles.

Q3. A magnetic domain is a finite region of a material in which the electron spins of atoms are lined up to a better extent than unmagnetized material. The small magnetic field from huge numbers of electrons produces a measureable and significant magnetic field in the permanent magnet.

Q4. There are no known magnetic monopoles. i.e. There are no isolated north or south poles. The magnetic effect is different than the electric effect. We won't delve into this too much but the magnetic effect for currents can be explained applying Einstein's Special Relativity theory to moving charges.

Q5. True θ has a value of 0 degrees so the sine function evaluates to zero.

### 22.6 The Hall Effect

#### To Do

* Describe the Hall effect.
* Calculate the Hall emf across a current-carrying conductor.

#### Notes

If necessary, your should review how the direction of the magnetic force is determined.

Q1. Why are physicists convinced that electrons are the charge carriers in a wire and not protons?

We will not calculate the emf generated by the Hall effect.

### 22.7 Magnetic Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor

#### To Do

* Describe the effects of a magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor.
* Calculate the magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor.

#### Notes

We have already discussed the magnetic force on a charged particle.

We treat the current as positive particles moving in the wire. The magnetic force on the wire is

F = ILB sinθ I is the current in amps, L is the length of the wire in the B field

```text
                    Θ is the angle between the direction of I and the direction of B.
```

We will use a right hand rule to find the direction of the force.

1. Extend the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the conventional current.
2. Rotate your wrist so it is easy to bend your fingers into the direction of the magnetic frield.
3. Your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic force.

Q2. When is the force a maximum value and when is it zero?

### 22.8 Torque on a Current Loop: Motors and Meters

#### To Do

* Describe how motors and meters work in terms of torque on a current loop.

#### Notes

You should understand the direction of the rotation of the loop. Use the right hand rule for a wire in a B field to get the direction of the force. The torque is the force times the lever arm. The torque can be clockwise or counterclockwise. We will not do calculations in this section.

How does a galvanometer display a reading that indicates the current value?

Q3. Why does the current need to reverse directions every half cycle in a simple motor?

### 22.9 Magnetic Fields Produced by Currents: Ampere's Law

#### To Do

* Calculate current that produces a magnetic field.
* Use the right hand rule 2 to determine the direction of current or the direction of magnetic field loops.

For a long straight wire B = \( μo I \)/ \( 2 π r\) μo = 4 π x 10-7 I is in amps

```text
                                                    r is the shortest distance from the wire in meters.
```

Ampere's Law and Others

Ampere's Law Σ B\|\| ΔL = μo I For simple geometries Ampere's Law can be used to find B without using Calculus.

Magnetic Field Produced by a Current-Carrying Circular Loop

A single loop of wire that has a current will create a magnetic field:

B = \( μo I \)/ \( 2 r\) This is the value of B at the center of the loop.

If there are multiple loops simply multiply by the number of loops, N.

B = \(N μo I \)/ \( 2 r\)

You can use the right hand rule to find the direction of B.

Magnetic Field Produced by a Current-Carrying Solenoid

A solenoid is a coil of wire in the shape of a cylinder. Inside the solenoid the magnetic field is nearly uniform and has a value of

B = \(N μo I \)/ L where L is the length of the solenoid and N is the number of turns of wire.

Or, B = n μo I where n is the number of turns of wire per meter.

Q4. How can the magnetic field inside a solenoid be increased?

Know how to make an electromagnet.

### 22.10 Magnetic Force between Two Parallel Conductors

#### To Do

* Describe the effects of the magnetic force between two conductors.
* Calculate the force between two parallel conductors.

To find the force for two long straight parallel wires that have current you first calculate B due to one of the wires at the location of the second wire. Then calculate the Force from F = I L B.

Q5. How is the Ampere unit defined?

### 22.11 More Applications of Magnetism

#### To Do

* Describe some applications of magnetism.

#### Notes

Mass Spectrometry

You should know how does a mass spectrometer works.

r = mv/\(qB\) You should know the source of this equation.

In order to calculate the mass, r is measured. Also, the velocity of the object must be known. The velocity selector uses an electric force and magnetic force to only allow a certain velocity to enter the region where there is only a magnetic field. If the ion source releases ions do you think the drawing in the text \(Figure 22.43\) shows the correct direction for the magnetic field \(given the + and – labels on the plates\)?

Why does the velocity of ions that make it through the gap in the wall = E/B ?

Describe what happens to ions that have a velocity above the desired velocity value.

Describe what happens to ions that have a velocity below the desired velocity value.

Other Applications

How does an ordinary speaker produce sound?

Why is coaxial cable used to carry TV \(and other\) signals?

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. A magnetic field deflects the charge carriers in a wire. The sides of the wire then have a potential difference due to this deflection of the charge carrier. Measurements of the sign of the potential difference show that electrons are the charge carriers in a wire.

Q2. The force is maximum if the current and the magnetic field are perpendicular \(angle 90 degrees\). The force is zero if the current and B field are parallel.

Q3. If the current did not reverse directions the torque would reverse directions. The coil of the motor would oscillate back and forth rather than continue its rotation in one direction.

Q4. Increase I, increase N, decrease L.

Q5. The ampere is defined based on the magnetic force between two long straight wires. When the current creates an interaction of 2 x 10-7 Newtons/meter the current value is 1 amp.
