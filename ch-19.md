Ch 19: Electric Potential and Electric Energy

### Introduction

Electrical problems can be solved using energy concepts instead of vectors. This concept \(Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy\) was used during the first semester of this course and will be used again now.

You will have to read carefully in this chapter. The terms "potential," "potential difference," and "potential energy" refer to different concepts.

### Terms to Know

* electric potential, electric potential energy, electron volt, voltage, equipotential
* voltage, capacitor, dielectric, series, parallel

### 19.1 Electric Potential Energy: Potential Difference

#### To Do

* Define electric potential and electric potential energy.
* Describe the relationship between potential difference and electrical potential energy.
* Explain electron volt and its usage in submicroscopic process.
* Determine electric potential energy given potential difference and amount of charge.

#### Notes

A positive charge that is located near a group of fixed positive charges will move and gain kinetic energy. There is a similarity between motion in electric fields and motion due to gravity. Both the gravitational force and the electric force are conservative \(they both have an associated potential energy\).

Work is required to move a positive charge \(charge 1\) from a location near negative charges towards a \(fixed\) positive charge \(charge 2\). The work done on charge 1 gives charge 1 potential energy. If charge 1 is released it will move away from charge 2 and will gain Kinetic Energy. When a positive charge is in a region of other positive charges it is similar to a mass being up above the surface of the Earth. When the mass is released it will move towards the ground. When the positive charge is released it will move away from the other positive charges.

Definition of Electric Potential

Important…Electric Potential is not the same as Potential Energy. You can have an electric potential with just one charge. Electric potential energy requires at least two charges.

PEA / q = VA VA is the electric potential at location A 1 Joule/ 1 Coulomb = 1 Volt

The work required to move a positive charge from location B towards location A is calculated using

WBA = q \* VBA VBA is the potential difference between locations A and B

Or, VBA = Change in PE / q Or, change in PE = q \* VBA

VBA = VB - VA Potential difference can be called "voltage."

Q1 Does the location where V = 0 make a difference in solving problems?

Know the difference between electric potential and potential energy.

What questions do you have on the examples worked in the textbook?

What is the relation of battery terminals and potential difference?

How is the electron volt \(eV\) defined?

Why is it used?

Is it a unit of energy or power or potential, etc.?

Conservation of Energy

KEi + PEi= KEf + PEf

In a typical problem the initial KE = 0 and the final PE = 0. The initial PE = qV and KE = ½ m v2

### 19.2 Electric Potential in a Uniform Electric Field

#### To Do

* Describe the relationship between voltage and electric field.
* Derive an expression for the electric potential and electric field.
* Calculate electric field strength given distance and voltage.

#### Notes

If the electric field is uniform \(constant\) then VBA = Ed or, E = VBA / d

Where d is the distance between points A and B.

VBA is often just replaced with ΔV. ΔV is the electric potential between two locations.

In the uniform field you can also calculate Work W = q ΔV and Force F = qE.

### 19.3 Electrical Potential Due to a Point Charge

#### To Do

* Explain point charges and express the equation for electric potential of a point charge.
* Distinguish between electric potential and electric field.
* Determine the electric potential of a point charge given charge and distance.

#### Notes

As our textbook points out, Calculus can be used to derive the expression for the potential at some distance, r, from a point charge. V = k q / r . V here is the potential at one location, not the potential difference. Note that V is positive when q is positive and V is negative when q is negative.

Note that V is a scalar, not a vector. This tends to make problems easier to solve than when E is used.

As r increases V decreases. Q2 What is the value of V when the point of interest is an infinite distance away from q?

To find V due to more than one point charge you simply add the separate V's. This is simpler than adding E's because you don't have to use components to add V's.

### 19.4 Equipotential Lines

#### To Do

* Explain equipotential lines and equipotential surfaces.
* Describe the action of grounding an electrical appliance.
* Compare electric field and equipotential lines.

#### Notes

What are equipotential lines and surfaces?

Do lines of equipotential stop or start on a charged object?

Q3 What is the shape of an equipotential line around a point charge?

When and why do we say that the surface of a conductor is an equipotential surface?

Know the relation \(orientation\) of electric field lines to lines of equal electric potential.

Why is the work equal to zero when a charge is moved along an equipotential?

Grounding refers to the process of having a conducting path to the Earth. The third connector on a modern electrical plug is the ground. The metal case of an appliance is connected to the ground as a safety mechanism.

You should be familiar with the sketches of E and equipotentials shown in the text.

ANSWERS …………….

Q1 No, only the difference in voltage is important in solving problems. A single voltage does not help you solve a problem.

Q2 V is equal to zero when the point of interest is infinitely far from the charge.

Q3 The equipotential is a circle. Every point o n the circle has the same value for r and thus the same value for V.

For electric circuits that do not use computer chips there are five main elements. 1\) a source of potential difference \(e.g. battery\), 2\) wires to provide a conducting path for electrons, 3\) resistors to limit the size of the flow of electrons, 4\) capacitors to store charge and energy, 5\) inductors to store energy and moderate the flow of electrons. We will cover capacitors in this section. Batteries, wires, and resistors will be discussed in the next chapter. Inductors will be discussed briefly when we discuss alternating current circuits and magnetism.

### 19.5 Capacitors and Dielectrics

#### To Do

* Describe the action of a capacitor and define capacitance.
* Explain parallel plate capacitors and their capacitances.
* Discuss the process of increasing the capacitance of a dielectric.
* Determine capacitance given charge and voltage.

#### Notes

A parallel plate capacitor has two metal plates facing each other at a close distance. When wires connect the plates of a capacitor to a battery electrons will move from one plate towards the positive terminal of the battery. Electrons will move from the negative terminal of the battery towards the other plate. There is an insulator \(air or some material\) between the plates of the capacitor.

Why is it reasonable that there is +Q on one plate and –Q on the other plate? \(i.e. why is the magnitude of charge the same on each plate?\)

The amount of charge stored on a capacitor is related the potential difference across the plates of the capacitor. Why is it reasonable that the charge on the plates is proportional to the potential difference?

Q = CV The capacitance value, C, is the constant of proportionality that changes the proportion between Q and V into an equation. C is the value of capacitance in Farads. C can be calculated from the geometry of a parallel plate capacitor using C = o A / d . A is area in m2, d is distance between the plates in meters. o is a constant, the "permittivity of free space" and has a value of 8.85 x 10-12 in standard metric units.

You will need to be careful in reading this chapter. When C is used in an equation it represents the capacitance value in units of Farads. But you will see C used to denote the value of charge in Coulombs.

Try to do this calculation: Suppose a parallel plate capacitor is made with two aluminum plates facing each other with 1 millimeter of air between the plates. The value of the capacitance is 1 Farad. If the plates are square what is the length of one edge of one of the square plates?

Q1. Does the capacitance value change as the voltage applied to the capacitor changes?

Be able to sketch the electric field in the vicinity of a parallel plate capacitor.

DIELECTRIC

When the dielectric is placed between the plates of the capacitor, it polarizes when the capacitor is charged. You should draw a parallel plate capacitor. Let the capacitor be charged and then disconnected from the battery. Draw dielectric between the plates and show the charged sides of the dielectric. \(This drawing is in the OpenStax textbook.\) The electric field created by the polarized dielectric partially cancels the electric field created by the charge on the plates of the capacitor. Recall Q = CV and E = V/d.

Since the net electric field is less the potential difference, V, between the plates is less. Q is constant when the capacitor is disconnected from the battery so C must be a larger number.

A dielectric, which is inserted between the plates of a capacitor, changes the capacitance value.

```text
   C = k o A/d        k is the dielectric constant.
```

Q2. Why is the dielectric strength an important characteristic of a dielectric?

### 19.6 Capacitors in Series and Parallel

#### To Do

* Derive expressions for total capacitance in series and in parallel.
* Identify series and parallel parts in the combination of connection of capacitors.
* Calculate the effective capacitance in series and parallel given individual capacitances.

#### Notes

You should learn to recognize when capacitors are connected in series and when they are connected in parallel. In the series arrangement the +Q plate of one capacitor is connected to the –Q plate of the next capacitor in a line. The potential differences of all of the capacitors add up to the potential difference of the battery \(if there are no other capacitors, resistors, or inductors in the circuit\). The series arrangement of capacitors can be replaced with one equivalent capacitor. The value of the equivalent capacitor is

1/CS = 1/C1 +1/C2 +1/C3 …

The value of the capacitor that is equivalent to the series arrangement is ALWAYS smaller than the smallest capacitor in the series. The value of the series arrangement is that the voltage across each capacitor is smaller than the battery voltage so the dielectric is in less danger of breaking down.

Capacitors are connected in parallel when all of the +Q plates are wired together and all of the –Q plates are wired together. The potential difference across each capacitor is the same value and is equal to the potential difference of the battery \(if there are no other capacitors, resistors, or inductors in the circuit\). The value of a single capacitor that is equivalent to the parallel capacitors is

CP = C1 + C2 + C3 …

The advantage of the parallel arrangement is that larger values of capacitance can be produced.

You will have to learn how to simplify circuits that have combinations of series and parallel capacitors. You will need to work one step at a time, finding either the equivalent capacitance for a series arrangement or an equivalent capacitance for a parallel arrangement.

### 19.7 Energy Stored in Capacitors

#### To Do

* List some uses of capacitors.
* Express in equation form the energy stored in a capacitor.
* Explain the function of a defibrillator.

#### Notes

When a capacitor has zero charge on its plate it is relatively easy for the battery to move one electron away from the +Q plate and deliver one electron to the –Q plate. To move the second electron more work \(energy is required\). To move the third electron even more energy is required. When the capacitor is fully charged the plates of the capacitor will have the same potential difference as the potential difference of the battery. With the potential of the +Q plate equal to the potential of the positive terminal of the battery there is no motivation for an electron to leave the +Q plate. Etc. for the –Q plate and the negative terminal of the battery. The battery has done work on the charges to create the charge arrangement of the capacitor.

The energy stored in a capacitor is calculated using Energy = 0.5CV2

I will not use E to represent energy as there is too much danger that you might assume the E represents the value of the electric field. Through the use of substitutions \(Q=CV\) you can modify the energy equation to suit the data in hand and calculate the energy stored in the capacitor.

How does a defibrillator use a capacitor?

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. No. The capacitance value only depends on the geometry of the capacitor and what type of material \(dielectric\) is between the plates of the capacitor. It is the charge on the plates that changes when the potential difference changes, not the capacitance value.

Q2. If the voltage across the plates \(potential difference\) is too high the electric field will be too high and the dielectric will break down and become a conductor. This is a dangerous situation for a capacitor as the electrons on the –Q plate will move through the dielectric to the +Q plate in a short time. The capacitor may explode due to the sudden release of energy.
