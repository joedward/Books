## Introduction

### Topics

- TBA

### Terms to Know

- cornea, iris, lens, retina, Near point, far point, nearsighted, farsighted, simple magnifier
- microscope, telescope, objective, eyepiece, magnification, chromatic and spherical aberration, adaptive optics

## 26.1 Physics of the Eye

### To Do

- Explain the image formation by the eye.
- Analyze the accommodation of the eye for distant and near vision.

### Notes

We will discuss the major optical features of the eye. We will treat the cornea and lens combination as a single thin lens.

Compare these parts of the eye to a camera:  pupil, retina, cornea, lens.

The image of any object must be focused on the retina to see a clear image.

Why is the image distance a fixed number for the eye?

How does the eye accomplish the focusing of objects that are different distances from the eye?

Q1. What is accommodation?

The muscles attached to the lens are able to change the shape of the lens and thus change its focal length.

Q2. Why do some older people wear bifocals or trifocals, etc.?

Q3. What are the near and far points?

Describe the change in the focal length that allows a person to clearly see a close object.

Power of a lens:   Diopters = 1 / f (in meters)

## 26.2 Vision Correction

### To Do

- Identify and discuss common vision defects.
- Explain nearsightedness and farsightedness corrections.

### Notes

What causes nearsightedness and how is it corrected?

What causes farsightedness and how is it corrected?

Know how to calculate the power of corrective lenses.

We will not discuss astigmatism or laser vision correction.

What questions do you have on the examples in the book?

In preparation for discussing microscopes and telescopes you should know the essential characteristics and working principle of the simple magnifier.

Magnification M = Near point distance / f     for image at infinity (relaxed eye)      Average near point = 25 cm

```
            Add 1 to M if the image is at the near point
```

## 26.3 Color and Color Vision

### Notes

You should read this section.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Accommodation refers to the changing of the focal length of the eye to cause objects with different object distances to be in focus.

Q2. As the body ages, the lens becomes less flexible and the muscles are not able to change its focal length as much.

Q3. The near point is the closest object distance for which the object can be seen clearly. The average near point for a young adult is 25 cm.

```
    The far point is the furthest object distance for which the object can be seen clearly. For a young eye this is infinity.
```

## 26.4 Microscopes

### To Do

- Investigate different types of microscopes.
- Learn how image is formed in a compound microscope, calculate magnification

### Notes

The microscopes we will discuss just have two lenses. Both lenses have a short focal length. Both lenses produce magnification of the object. You should know how to do the ray tracing to locate the intermediate and final image for a microscope that uses two converging lenses.

Q1. Why does the objective magnify the object?

Q2. Why does the eyepiece magnify the image created by the objective?

The magnification is found by multiplying the magnification for each lens. mobj \* meyepiece

For each lens, the magnification is -di / do .

You should read about the numerical aperture, or f/number.

As will be discussed in a future chapter, if the wavelength is shorter the microscope is better able to see details in an object. We will find in a future chapter that particles act as waves when they travel. The wavelength of the electrons can be selected to be smaller than violet light so small objects can be imaged.

## 26.5 Telescopes

### To Do

- Outline the invention and use of a telescope.
- Describe the working of a telescope, light gathering power, magnification

### Notes

The telescope was invented in the Netherlands by Hans Lippershey. Galileo made telescopes and was the first to record and publish extensive observations of objects with the telescope. His observations (1609) showed that the Earth was not the center of the solar system.

The main purpose of a telescope is to gather light so dim objects can be viewed. The light gathering power depends on the area of the objective. Telescopes are usually compared with ratios of the squares of the diameters. e.g. 11 inch diameter telescope vs. 8 inch diameter telescope

11 inch telescope gathers more light by a factor of    112 / 82   =   1.89 or almost 2 times more light

Q3. What is the difference between a refracting and a reflecting telescope?

Know how to do the ray tracing to locate the intermediate and final image for the case of two converging lenses.

Know the purpose of the objective and the eyepiece.

```
    M = - fo / fe
```

If you purchase a telescope is the diameter of the objective or the magnifying power most important?

Q4. What are two advantages of a reflecting telescope over a refracting telescope?

Know how to make a Galilean telescope and its advantage over the simple telescope.

TRUE or FALSE  The Hubble telescope produces images that show more details than any other telescope for astronomical objects.

Why do reflecting telescopes not suffer from chromatic aberration?  And, what prevents the largest telescopes from being made with a lens for the objective?

## 26.6 Aberrations

### To Do

- Describe spherical and chromatic aberration and know how they are corrected

### Notes

How is dispersion related to chromatic aberration?

Chromatic aberration can be minimized by using an &quot;achromat&quot; lens. This is a two lens combination of converging and diverging lenses that have different indices of refraction. It is expensive.

Q5. How can spherical aberration be minimized?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. The object is a short distance beyond the focal length so do so di is large and the magnification is large.

Q2. The image formed by the objective is inside the focal length of the eyepiece. The eyepiece acts as simple magnifier.

Q3. Refracting: a lens is used for the objective. Reflecting: A mirror is used for the objective.

Q4. The reflecting telescope does not have chromatic aberration from the objective and can be made larger than a refracting telescope.

Q5. Use a parabolic mirror, or an expensive non-spherical lens. Or, just use the section of the objective near the optic axis by blocking the outer portion of the objective.
