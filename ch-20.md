## Ch 20: Electric Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law

### Introduction

For electric circuits that do not use computer chips there are five main elements. 1\) a source of potential difference \(e.g. battery\), 2\) wires to provide a conducting path for electrons, 3\) resistors to limit the size of the flow of electrons, 4\) capacitors to store charge and energy, 5\) inductors to store energy and moderate the flow of electrons.

Electricity is a tool that drives much of our technology. Electric circuits provide the means for delivering a controlled amount of energy to a destination. Take a moment to make a mental list of all the electrical devices you use on a daily basis that you would miss if they did not exist.

### Terms to Know

* current, conventional current, drift velocity, resistance, resistivity, power, energy
* power, Joule heating, direct current, alternating current, rms, short circuit

### 20.1 Current

#### To Do

* Define electric current, ampere, and drift velocity
* Describe the direction of charge flow in conventional current.
* Use drift velocity to calculate current and vice versa.

#### Notes

We have now left the realm of static electricity. When a potential difference exists in a conductor there will be motion of charge \(electrons for the case of a solid\). We will not discuss current in liquids and gases where the positive ions could contribute to the current value. The current \(Amperes\) is defined as the quantity of charge in Coulombs that passes one point in one second.

To calculate current you will use I = Q/t I is the current in Amperes, Q is the charge in Coulombs and t is the time in seconds.

Schematic diagrams show the key components and wires in a circuit. You should memorize the symbols used in schematic diagrams.

We will follow the 200+ years of tradition and label the current in the circuit as if positive charge was moving in the wire. This is known as the conventional current. The assumption that + charges move in a solid is a continuation of Franklin's model for electric charge. For most situations the analysis of the circuit and its effects does not depend on whether + or – charge is moving in the circuit.

Since each atom in the conductor has one or two "free" \(easily shared\) electrons, and objects have tremendous numbers of atoms, there are tremendous numbers of electrons available to move in an object. We don't see the discrete nature of electric current \(single charges moving\) due to the small size and great numbers of electrons in a conductor.

Drift Velocity

TRUE or FALSE A typical wire used in buildings or houses is a hollow cylinder which allows electrons to freely move from the – potential to the + potential of the circuit.

When a potential difference is established between the ends of a conductor an electric field is established in the conductor. Recall E = V/d This electric field propagates \(is established\) throughout the conductor at about the speed of light. The electric field accelerates the electrons and they pick up speed. The moving electrons quickly hit atoms in the wire and bounce back but the electric field restores their velocity until another collision occurs. The electrons to not accelerate to a high speed. The electrons deliver KE to the atoms in the wire and wire temperature increases. Have you ever felt the temperature of a wire connected to a lamp? The electrons actually make slow progress through the wire. The typical velocity of the electrons in a conductor is 1 x 10-4 m/s. This is known as the drift velocity.

Q1. Suppose that a lightbulb is 6 centimeters away from the switch on a flashlight. Calculate the length of time required for an electron to move from the switch to the lightbulb. Why does the flashlight go on almost immediately?

I = nqAvd . n is the density of charge carriers, q is the charge on an electron, A is the cross-sectional area, and vd is the drift velocity.

### 20.2 Ohm's Law: Resistance and Simple Circuits

#### To Do

* Explain the origin of Ohm's law.
* Calculate voltages, currents, or resistances with Ohm's law.
* Explain what an ohmic material is.
* Describe a simple circuit.

#### Notes

A battery produces potential difference due to chemical reactions inside the battery. We will not discuss those reactions. The battery maintains a \(relatively\) constant potential difference until the chemical energy is depleted.

It was observed in the 1800's that the current in a circuit is proportional to the voltage applied to the circuit. \(Voltage applied = potential difference.\) The constant of proportionality is the resistance, R, of the circuit. V = I R Ohm's Law

Conductors in which I is linearly proportional to V are called ohmic materials. Ordinary wires are ohmic if the temperature of the wire is relatively constant. Examples of non-ohmic materials are light bulb filaments \(large temperature change\), transistors, computer chips, etc.\). In a non-ohmic material the resistance changes as the current changes.

The schematic symbol for a battery is a set of parallel lines in which the longer line is the + terminal. The symbol for a resistor is a pointed-squiggly line.

We will trace around electric circuits starting from the + terminal of the battery. We will label the – terminal of the battery with 0 volts. So, if we start at the + terminal of a 9 volt battery we have to lose 9 volts someplace in the circuit to reach 0 volts at the – terminal. We will treat the wires as ideal \( 0 resistance\) for most problems that have other finite resistors in the circuit. The 9 volts of potential will be lost in the resistor. The "voltage drop" across the resistor \(and other circuit elements\) can be calculated with V = I R where I is the current in the resistor and R is the value of the resistor.

The water pipe analogy is OK but lacks the complete circuit effect that is present for electrical circuits. When you use a garden hose the water does not go back to the water supply directly in a pipe.

The PhET simulation on Ohm's Law will give you a quick feel for the relationship of V, I, and R.

### 20.3 Resistance and Resistivity

#### To Do

* Explain the concept of resistivity.
* Use resistivity to calculate the resistance of specified configurations of material.
* Use the thermal coefficient of resistivity to calculate the change of resistance with temperature.

#### Notes

You should read and understand the factors that affect the resistance of a conductor.

You can calculate the resistance of a wire using R = \(ρ L\) / A

ρ is the resistivity. This is a property of the type of conductor \(gold, silver, copper, carbon, etc. \) \(and its temperature\). L is the length in meters. A is the cross-sectional area in m2 .

Why is silicon known as a semiconductor?

ρ = ρ0\(1 + αΔT\) α is a coefficient that is different for different materials. It has typical values of about 3 x 10-3. ΔT is the change in temperature in units of Celsius.

What is the approximate change in temperature needed to double the resistivity for a typical conductor?

Q2. Does resistivity usually increase or decrease as the temperature of the material increases?

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. Distance = rate \* time time = distance/rate t = .06m / 1 x 10-4 m/s t = 600 seconds

Or t = 10 minutes! You don't have to wait 10 minutes for a flashlight to turn on because the electric field is established very quickly and there is an electron right next to the light bulb filament that is ready to do work on the filament to increase it's temperature. Also, the filament has low thermal inertia so it does not take long to reach the temperature at which it emits visible light.

Q2. For conductors the resistance increases as the temperature increases. The resistance of a light bulb is larger when it is on than when it is off.

### 20.4 Electric Power and Energy

#### To Do

* Calculate the power dissipated by a resistor and power supplied by a power supply.
* Calculate the cost of electricity under various circumstances.

#### Notes

Recall from first semester that Power = Work / Time . We can calculate a power rating for an element in an electrical circuit using Power = I V where P is the power \(in Watts\), I is the current \(in amps\) in the element and V is the potential difference \(in volts\) across the element. You should understand how the textbook derives the P=IV relationship. This relationship is reasonable. If I is higher than there are more electrons per second moving past a point in the element and more collisions are occurring. If V is higher than the electrons will be in a region of higher potential difference, higher E, and they will have higher KE when they collide with atoms in the element.

If the material is ohmic we can substitute V = IR to produce P = I2R .

"Joule heating" refers to the process of raising the temperature of a conductor by passing an electric current through the conductor. The power deposited in the conductor multiplied by time is equal to the energy deposited in the conductor. From first semester we know energy = mass \* specific heat \* change in temperature. In some situations Joule heating is desired: toaster, electric blanket, etc. In some situations Joule heating is a danger: extension cord, household wiring, etc.

The Cost of Electricity

Power = Energy / time so Energy = Power \* time

Utilities charge for the energy delivered to a home or business. Utilities tell customers how much energy they consumed by reporting the kilowatt-hours \(kWh\) consumed. The cost of electricity varies from state to state. A typical value is around 10 cents/kWh.

Q1. Why is there a push to switch from incandescent bulbs to fluorescent or LED lights?

### 20.5 Alternating Current versus Direct Current

#### To Do

* Explain the differences and similarities between AC and DC current.
* Calculate rms voltage, current, and average power.
* Explain why AC current is used for power transmission.

#### Notes

Direct current \(DC\) is current in which the electrons only move in one direction.

Alternating current \(AC\) is current in which the electrons alternate the direction of motion.

Q2. Why would electrons alternate their direction of motion in a wire?

V = V0 sin\(2π ft\) I = I0 sin\(2π ft\) f is the frequency and V0 and I0 are the peak values.

We can still use V = I R at any instant of time.

To compare DC and AC circuits it is common to use the root-mean-square \(rms\) values for the AC circuit. Irms = I0 / sqrt\(2\) Vrms = V0 / sqrt\(2\)

The average power in the AC circuit is Pave = Irms Vrms and Vrms = Irms R

Why Use AC for Power Distribution?

There was a major competition between Edison \(favored DC\) and Tesla \(favored AC\) when electrical power became available to consumers at the end of the 1800's.

Q3, TRUE or FALSE Joule heating of long distance \( &gt; 100 miles\) transmission lines is undesirable.

Joule heating depends on the square of the current. \( P = I2R \) The power delivered P = I V. There is an easy way \(discussed in a future chapter\) of changing V for AC electricity. AC electricity is used for our power grid because the Joule heating is smaller than the Joule heating for a DC power grid.

### 20.6 Electric Hazards and the Human Body

#### To Do

* Define thermal hazard, shock hazard, and short circuit.

#### Notes

You should be aware that overheated wires can start a fire.

Why are fuses or circuit breakers used in homes?

You should be aware that electrical currents in the body can disrupt muscle action and heartbeats.

How can you avoid receiving an electrical shock?

In a short circuit the resistance of the circuit is near 0. The current value becomes large. And the Joule heating becomes large.

### 20.7 Nerve Conduction–Electrocardiograms

#### Notes

You should read this section if you have a health related career field.

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. Incandescent bulbs have hot wires inside. Most of the electrical energy goes to the infrared portion of the spectrum. Only 2% of the energy becomes visible light. Fluorescent bulbs convert about 20% of the electrical energy into visible light. \([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent\_lighting\#Luminous\_efficacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lighting#Luminous_efficacy)\).

Q2. When the potential difference across the wire reverses, the electric field reverses direction and the velocity of the electrons reverses direction. In the USA this happens 60 times a second for our electrical power. Our electrical power is known as "60 cycle" power.

Q3. True Joule heating is waste heat. The wires heat up but no useful work is done for the consumer. The energy used to heat the transmission wires is wasted.
