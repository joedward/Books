# Introduction to Quantum Physics

## Introduction

In the early 1900&#39;s physicists realized that the behavior of small objects was different from the classical physics models. We used this concept in the early part of the semester by saying that charge comes in packages of n \* 1.6 x 10-19 Coulombs. This is an example of quantization. But, there is much more than just quantization. We will discover that small objects can act like waves and apply that concept to better understand the atom. Again, there will be a correspondence principle in that the results of this chapter simplify to the classical physics equations for large objects.

## 29.1 Quantization of Energy

### To Do

-

- Explain Max Planck&#39;s contribution to the development of quantum mechanics.
- Explain why atomic spectra indicate quantization.

### Notes

A blackbody emits light at all wavelengths. The characteristics of the spectrum of the blackbody depend only on the temperature of the object, not on what type of elements are in the blackbody.

Solid objects, liquids, and dense gases emit light like a blackbody

The total power emitted by a sphere that is a blackbody is proportional to R2 T4 .

R is radius, T is temperature in Kelvins.

The energy emitted by a blackbody is not the same at all wavelengths. The radiation from a blackbody peaks at a wavelength that is related to the temperature of the object. Cool objects peak in the infrared, hotter objects peak in the ultraviolet.

Wien&#39;s Law lets us calculate the wavelength at which the most energy is being emitted by the blackbody.

```
    λmax = 2.9 x 10-3 /T  meters. T in Kelvins
```

The blackbody spectrum presents a problem to classical physics. The equations and understanding of classical physics cannot predict the observed spectrum of a blackbody. Some equations will match the spectrum at small wavelengths but be wrong at long wavelengths. Some equations will match the spectrum at long wavelengths but fail at short wavelengths. Physicists wanted to find one equation that would correctly describe the whole spectrum.

Planck derived the formula that correctly describes the blackbody spectrum only after he assumed that the energy of the oscillating atoms were quantized with E = (n + ½ ) h f

```
    n is an integer 0, 1, 2…     h is Planck&#39;s constant. 6.626x10-34 J seconds    f is frequency
```

Planck thought this restriction on the energy was just a mathematical trick that allowed him to derive the equation for the blackbody. However, this quantization of energy is real.

Q1. What is the smallest change in energy for an oscillator?   (Hint: e.g. N goes from 0 to 1.)

Atomic Spectra

List one feature of atomic spectra that is much different than the spectra of blackbodies.

The spectra have discrete features (emission lines or absorption lines) that are unique for each element. These spectra will be important in developing models for the atom in Chapter 30.

## 29.2 The Photoelectric Effect

### To Do

-

- Describe a typical photoelectric-effect experiment.
- Determine the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons ejected by photons of one energy or wavelength, when given the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons for a different photon energy or wavelength.

### Notes

When ultraviolet light falls on a set of wires it is easier to create a spark between the two wires. This suggests that the light is causing electrons to leave the wires and help in breaking down the insulating gap of air.

What is the photoelectric effect?

What is a photon?

You should be familiar with the 5 characteristics of the photoelectric effect. #3 is the only characteristic that agrees with classical physics. Characteristics 1,2,4, and 5 can only be explained using another new understanding of how the universe works; the photon model for light.

It is important to note that the KE in 5) is the maximum KE of the electrons. The electrons that are ejected from the surface of the metal will have this maximum KE. Electrons that are ejected from slightly under the surface have less KE. The BE quantity is often called the Work function and W is used as the symbol in other physics textbooks.

KE max = hf – BE

Einstein came up with this equation in 1905 and the model that light acts like a photon when the light is absorbed. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 for the explanation of the photoelectric effect. List some devices that use the photoelectric effect.

## 29.3 Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum

### To Do

-

- Explain the relationship between the energy of a photon in joules or electron volts and its wavelength or frequency.
- Calculate the number of photons per second emitted by a monochromatic source of specific wavelength and power.

### Notes

With the photon model we can easily calculate the energy associated with a particular wavelength of light. E = hf   and f = c / λ

It is more convenient to work with electron-volts (eV) than Joules for most atomic calculations. Planck&#39;s constant has a value of about 4.14 x 10-15 eV seconds .

A typical ionization energy is around 10 eV.

Q2. Define &quot;ionizing radiation.&quot;

Does visible light fall into the category of ionizing radiation?

You should be aware of how x-rays are produced but we will not do calculations for the voltage of the equipment.

## 29.4 Photon Momentum

### To Do

-

- Relate the linear momentum of a photon to its energy or wavelength
- Describe what occurs in the Compton effect.

### Notes

Experiments performed by Compton in the 1920&#39;s confirmed that light makes collisions with electrons and momentum is conserved. Photon momentum  p = h/λ

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. The smallest change in energy = hf.

Q2. Light (or alpha or beta particles) that can give an atom enough energy to remove an electron from the atom.

## 29.5 The Particle-Wave Duality

### To Do

-

- Explain what the term particle-wave duality means, and why it is applied to EM radiation.

### Notes

Interference and diffraction show that light travels as a wave. The photoelectric effect shows that light should be treated like a particle (photon) when light is absorbed. This dual nature is far from a classical physics concept. But, experimental evidence supports this particle-wave dual explanation. You apply the correct model for the situation at hand.

What questions do you have on particle-wave duality?

## 29.6 The Wave Nature of Matter

### To Do

-

- Describe the Davisson-Germer experiment, and explain how it provides evidence for the wave nature of electrons.

### Notes

Q1. Why did de Broglie propose that matter has a wave behavior?

```
de Broglie wavelength      = h/(mv)
```

Why don&#39;t you observe the wave nature of a baseball as it is thrown?

What experimental evidence indicates that de Broglie was correct?

How is the wave nature of the electron used in an application?

## 29.7 Probability: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

### To Do

-

- Use both versions of Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle in calculations.
- Explain the implications of Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle for measurements.

### Notes

Probability Distribution

Quantum Mechanics lets scientists calculate the probability that a particle will be in a certain range of locations or the probability that an object will have an energy within some range of energies. The textbook shows the probability distribution for an electron after the electron passes through two slits. This should remind you of the interference pattern you observed when light passes through two slits. Fig 29.26 is mislabeled for the b) frame. It should read &quot;photons&quot; not &quot;protons.&quot;

It is also worth noting that if you try to measure which slit the electron passed through you destroy the interference pattern.

Heisenberg Uncertainty

On a fundamental level, it turns out that there is an inherent uncertainty in the knowledge of measured items. In fact, the act of measurement disturbs the system and gives uncertainty to the measured items.

The uncertainty principle we will use for position and momentum is:

∆X  ∆px  \&gt;  h/(4 π )        ∆X is the uncertainty in the X location

```
                    ∆px is the uncertainty in the X component of the momentum
```

∆px will sometimes be expressed as m∆Vx  (mass times uncertainty in the X component of the velocity).

If you try to obtain better information on the location of a particle you will lose the ability to have accurate information on the velocity of the particle. You can visualize this result by recalling how the diffraction pattern spread out when the single slit became narrower. Narrowing the slit is equivalent to trying to obtain better information on the location. As this is done, the light had more uncertainty (spread out more) on where it would strike the screen. The central maximum spread out.

Q2. What makes the uncertainty in the velocity in the X direction larger?

There is also an uncertainty principle for energy and time:

   ∆E   ∆t   \&gt;  h/(4 π)                  ∆E   is the uncertainty in the energy value (in Joules)

```
                            ∆t is the length of time during which the energy value is measured.
```

Q3. What makes the uncertainty in the energy value larger?

The uncertainty principle for energy plays a role in alpha decay from nuclei. For a short time the kinetic energy of the alpha particle will be negative.

## 29.8 The Particle-Wave Duality Reviewed

### To Do

-

- Explain the concept of particle-wave duality, and its scope.

### Notes

The concepts of particle-wave duality and uncertainty principles apply to all objects. But, it is only for small objects that the effect is important. When macroscopic objects are involved the equations of classical physics can be used.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. He assumed that nature was symmetric. With light having a particle and wave nature he assumed that matter would have the same behavior.

Q2. Any attempt to obtain better information on the X position will make the uncertainty in the X component of the momentum larger.

Q3. If the energy measurement is made during a shorter time interval, the uncertainty in the energy value is greater. This has applications in the emission of light from atoms and subatomic particles.
