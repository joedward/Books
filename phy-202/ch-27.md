## Wave Optics

### Introduction

Try to recall some situations in which you have seen colors when white light reflects off of a surface \(e.g. soap bubble, oil slick on the street, butterfly wings, CD or DVD... optional site: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural\_coloration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration)\). If the law of reflection is true \(it is\) and all colors reflect at the same angle, why are different colors seen at different angles? This chapter will explain these effects. This chapter will involve situations where the energy of the light does NOT simply travel in straight lines.

### 27.1 The Wave Aspect of Light: Interference

#### To Do

* Discuss the wave character of light.
* Identify the changes when light enters a medium.

#### Notes

Maxwell developed equations that showed light is an electromagnetic wave. When light interacts with large objects \( much larger than the wavelength\) you can use the ray model and geometric optics to locate the images. You should calculate the wavelength for visible light.

c = f λ We will need to treat the light as a wave as it moves past and interacts with objects that have a size smaller than, or comparable to, the wavelength of the light.

Explanations for Figure 27-3: In the top frame the laser is not making the star nor the Milky Way glow. The photographer chose to take the picture from a location that put the laser in line with those objects. In the bottom frame, as few as two vertical slits can be used to make this photo. The number of bright spots you see from left to right is NOT equal to the number of vertical slits.

In class and lab we may see a demonstration of laser light passing through two parallel slits. We will NOT see two spots of light on the screen after the laser light passes through two slits. We will see the interference pattern shown in the lower frame of Figure 27-3.

Q1. Consider a ray of light entering a medium after traveling in air. What two properties of the light change?

We will need this equation when we discuss thin films in a future section: λ' = λ / n

### 27.2 Huygens's Principle: Diffraction

#### To Do

* Discuss Huygens's principle.

#### Notes

A wavelet is a small semicircle that is drawn in the direction that the wave is traveling. The center point of the wavelet is on the wavefront of the wave.

Write out Huygen's Principle here.

We will not use Huygen's Principle to determine how light waves reflect, refract, or behave when moving past an object.

Why does sound "bend" around corners? The answer is not that the sound is reflecting off of walls or the floor or ceiling.

### 27.3 Young's Double Slit Experiment

#### To Do

* Explain the phenomena of interference.
* Define constructive interference for a double slit and destructive interference for a double slit.
* · Calculate the angles and distances to bright and dark spots on the screen

#### Notes

Newton proposed that light was best described as particles that traveled in straight lines. Huygens proposed that light traveled as a wave

Q2. How could scientists decide who was right?

If you shine a flashlight at a piece of cardboard that has two adjacent thin openings what would you expect for the pattern of light on the other side of the cardboard?

Coherent light has the peaks of the waves aligned with other peaks. \(analogy: everyone in a marching band steps forward with their left foot at the same time\).

Monochromatic light has only one wavelength \(specific color\) .

What is your conclusion about the nature of light after you examine the drawing of Young's Double Slit Experiment \(1801\) \(Figure 27.10\)?

Write down your definition of

constructive interference destructive interference

Note that Figure 27.12 shows monochromatic, coherent light, passing through the slits.

You should write down your summary of why some locations on the screen are bright and why some locations on the screen are dark.

The "take home" experiment regarding looking at a street light through the gap in two fingers is a diffraction effect that will be explained in a future section.

Double Slit Interference

What causes the waves from the two slits in the double slit experiment to be out of phase?

… to be in phase?

The angles to the bright spots on the screen are found using:

d sin θ = m λ m = … -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …

The angles to the dark spots on the screen are found using:

d sin θ = \(m + ½\) λ m = … -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …

The central maximum occurs for m = 0 \(0th order\).

The first maximum on either side of the central maximum occurs for m = -1 and m = +1.

\(1st order\)

To calculate distances on the screen: tan θ = Y/L Y is the distance from the central maximum to the location on the screen. L is the distance from the double slit to the screen.

Q3. Why is the interference pattern only seen when coherent sources are used?

Would you expect to see an interference pattern from two thin light bulbs that are set up 0.3 centimeters from each other? Explain.

What questions do you have on the examples worked out in the textbook?

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. The speed of light is slower in the medium than in air. The wavelength of the light is also reduced by a factor of n, the index of refraction. The frequency of the light wave is constant.

Q2. A controlled experiment is used to determine which hypothesis is false. The appropriate experiment here is to let light pass through two slits and observe if two spots are observed on a screen or if more than two spots are observed.

Q3. If the source is not coherent the waves at the two openings will not be in phase. There will be some random phase relationship. The waves have to be in phase at the slits to have the constructive interference occur at one location on the screen. If the waves are incoherent at the two slits there will be constructive interference \(and destructive interference\) at all points along the screen for each individual wave leaving the slits. You would see dim light spread out along the screen instead of alternating bright and dark spots on the screen.

### 27.4 Multiple Slit Diffraction

#### To Do

* Discuss the pattern obtained from diffraction grating.
* Explain diffraction grating effects.

#### Notes

Write a description of a diffraction grating.

When monochromatic, coherent, light passes through a diffraction grating maxima and minima are produced at the same angles that result when the same wavelength light passes through a double slit.

The angles to the bright spots on the screen are found using:

d sin θ = m λ m = … -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …

Q1. What two advantages does the diffraction grating have over just two slits?

The angle to the maxima depends on the wavelength of the light. As Figures 27.16 and 27.20 show, the diffraction grating will separate the colors \(wavelengths\) of light and allow scientists to inspect the amount of light for each color \(wavelength\).

How does the spectrum formed by a prism compare to the spectrum formed by a diffraction grating? \(e.g. Which color is dispersed by the greatest angle for the prism and for the diffraction grating?\)

Q2. Why is it often true that only the first order \(m=1\) and second order \(m=2\) maxima are present when a diffraction grating is used? \(i.e. There are no maxima for m=3 or m=4, etc.\)

What causes iridescence?

What questions do you have on the examples in the textbook?

### 27.5 Single Slit Diffraction

#### To Do

* Discuss and calculate the single slit diffraction pattern.
* Understand what causes missing orders.

#### Notes

Write a summary of what leads to interference of light when only a single slit is used.

The angle to the minima \(destructive interference\) for the single slit diffraction are computed using

D sin θ = m λ m = … -3, -2, -1, \(skip 0\), 1, 2, 3, … D is the width of the slit.

Q3. There is no simple equation for the location of the maxima for the double slit. Where are the maxima located for the single slit diffraction pattern?

The maxima become less bright as the angle increases. This is shown in Figure 27.24.

Q4. Each slit of a double slit acts as a single slit. Suppose that the double slit equation predicts a maximum at an angle of 8 degrees but the single slit equation predicts a minimum at the angle of 8 degrees. What will be seen on the screen, a maximum \(bright spot\) or a minimum \(dark spot\)?

A missing order occurs when the angle for a maximum from the double slit equation is the same as the angle for a minimum predicted by the single slit equation.

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. Advantage \#1: The maxima are narrower when a diffraction grating is used. The maxima are narrower because the light contributed from the slits will start to produce destructive interference at angles just slightly different from the angle calculated from the double slit equation. Since there are more slits the light can become out of phase for slits that are far from each other when the angle is slightly different than the angle calculated from the double slit equation.

Advantage\#2: Usually, the distance between slits for the diffraction grating is much smaller than the distance between slits for the double slit. This causes the angle to the maxima to be larger. This allows for a better determination of the angle for a certain color and a better determination of the wavelength for that color.

Q2. The equation for the diffraction grating maxima is: d sin θ = m λ . The value of sin θ must be less than 1 in order to take the invers sine function and find the angle. d is small. When m becomes larger sin θ can be greater than 1 for visible light. If sin θ is greater than 1 the maxima does not exist.

Q3. The maxima for the single slit fringe pattern are about halfway between the minima.

Q4. A dark spot is observed. The single slit prediction dominates the pattern. At the 8 degree angle there is 0 light from each slit. You could say that there is constructive interference with the light from the two slits, but the constructive interference is 0 + 0 with the result of 0.

### 27.6 Limits of Resolution: The Rayleigh Criterion

#### To Do

* Discuss the Rayleigh criterion.
* Calculate the minimum angle for resolving objects
* Calculate the physical distance between objects that are resolved

#### Notes

Q1. Why does a beam of light spread out after it passes through a circular opening?

Figure 27.25 illustrates the problem in resolving two objects. The images of the objects have an inherent width due to diffraction. If the objects are too close together \(frame c\) the objects are not clearly separated and are said to "not be resolved." Imagine that you want to see craters on the Moon. If the two craters are too close together their images overlap due to diffraction and you cannot see the two separate craters.

Write down the definition for the Rayleigh criterion.

The angle to the first minimum in the diffraction pattern for a circular opening is approximately:

θ =1.22 λ / D Note that the wavelength and diameter must be in the same units. The units of θ are radians. There is no sine function in this equation.

You should perform the take home experiment to test the resolving ability of your eyes. The angle θ can be calculated by suing s = r θ. S is the distance between the lines. r is the distance from your eyes to the lines.

Describe how you would improve the resolution of an optical system. \(two ways\)

What questions do you have on the calculations for this topic?

Q2. Does the Hubble telescope produce the highest resolution images of any telescope?

### 27.7 Thin Film Interference

#### To Do

* Discuss the rainbow formation by thin films.
* Calculate the thickness of a thin film

#### Notes

Vibrant colors can be produced when light reflects from a thin film. Some of the light reflects from the top of the thin film and a portion of the light refracts into the thin film. Then, some of the light in the thin film reflects from the back surface of the thin film and refracts out into the air. The two beams of light can constructively and destructively interfere at certain wavelengths based on the type of material in the thin film and the thickness of the thin film.

The thin film will have a thickness comparable to the wavelength of light, but we will not analyze this as a diffraction situation. The constructive or destructive interference is produced by the two beams having an "in phase" or "out of phase" relationship.

We will not use a single equation to produce a prediction of in phase or out of phase. Instead, you will need to understand the physics of how the light reflects and understand the extra path length to know if the two beams are in phase or out of phase.

Q3. When does reflection cause a phase shift of ½ wavelength?

Note: There is no phase change when refraction occurs.

In the thin film the wavelength is different than the wavelength in air. Again, we will take the index of refraction in air to be 1.0. The wavelength in the thin film is λ' = λ / n where n is the index of refraction of the thin film.

Problem Solving Steps to find the thickness of a thin film.

1. Know whether the two beams need to be in phase or out of phase at the eye.
2. Label any half wavelength shifts due to reflection.
3. Calculate the wavelength in the thin film.
4. Calculate the total path in the film in units of λ' required to produce in phase or out of phase. \(e.g. 1 λ' or ½ λ'\) We will not account for the slanted path in the thin film. We will assume the angle is small and that the slanted path is approximately equal to the thickness of the thin film.
5. Calculate the thickness of the film in metric units. \(often in units of nanometers\)

Applications: soap bubble, oil film, anti-reflective coating on glasses or camera lenses.

What questions do you have on the calculations for this topic?

Usually, we will only calculate the minimum thickness for the thin film. Thicker thin films will also have certain colors that are bright or missing.

### 27.8 Polarization

#### To Do

-

* Discuss the meaning of polarization.
* . Describe how Polaroids produce polarized light
* . Calculate the intensity of light that passes through Polaroids
* . Describe how reflection and scattering can polarize light
* Describe how LCD displays use polarization.

#### Notes

What is Maxwell's description for light?

Q4. When is light said to be linearly polarized?

A beam of unpolarized light has all possible directions for the vibrations of the electric vectors of the light.

Describe vertically polarized light.

Describe horizontally polarized light.

Figure 27.38 shows the effect on how a polarized wave can be created. However, this figure is misleading regarding how polarized light is produced with a Polaroid.

How does a polaroid produce polarized light?

When unpolarized light passes through a Polaroid, 50% of the light is blocked by the Polaroid.

The intensity of polarized light the exits a Polaroid is given by: I = Io cos2 θ

Io is the intensity of the polarized light before it enters the Polaroid.

Θ is the angle between the direction of the electric vector of the polarized light and the polarization direction for the Polaroid.

Q5. What are crossed polaroids?

Unpolarized light is directed at crossed polaroids. What is the intensity of the light that exits crossed polaroids?

You should know that reflection from a horizontal surface can create horizontally polarized light. We will not perform the calculate that describes this process. Sunglasses are made to block light that is horizontally polarized so they block the glare of light that is reflecting from a horizontal surface.

The light of the blue sky is partially polarized due to the scattering of light from molecules. If it is not too cloudy we will view this.

Liquid Crystal Displays Be able to give a basic explanation on how LCDs operate.

You should read section 27.9 but this reading guide does not discuss this section.

ANSWERS ……………………..

Q1. Diffraction The wave nature of light causes the light to spread out as it passes through an opening, whether the opening is a rectangular slit or a circle.

Q2. No. The detail available in Hubble images is better than the details available in most Earth-based telescopes due to the "twinkling" effect caused by our atmosphere. Turbulence in the atmosphere leads to the production of small, local, density variations in the atmosphere. These density variations have different indices of refraction and act like small, moving, lenses to light passing through the atmosphere. Some telescopes on Earth are equipped with "adaptive optics" to compensate for the twinkling effect. A laser is used to create an artificial star in the upper atmosphere. The telescope has a small flexible mirror in the optical path. The shape of this flexible mirror is continuously varied by equipment to keep the artificial star as small as possible. The astronomical image of the object that is near, but does not include, the artificial star can show more detail than the images produced by the Hubble telescope because the diameter of the mirror on the Earth-based telescope is larger than the diameter of the Hubble telescope. However the area of the sky in these adaptive optics images is smaller than the area of the sky imaged by the Hubble telescope, so the Hubble telescope is still useful.

Q3. A half-wavelength phase shift only occurs if the ray reflects from a medium that has a higher index of refraction than the medium the ray moves in before the reflection.

Q4. Light is linearly polarized if all of the electric vectors in the beam of light are aligned in one direction.

Q5. When two sheets of Polaroid have parallel faces but have 90 degrees between their polarization directions they are called crossed Polaroids.
