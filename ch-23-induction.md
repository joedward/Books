## Introduction

Electric current creates magnetic field. In this chapter you learn how a magnetic field can be used to create electric current. Batteries create current by converting chemical energy to electrical energy. In this chapter you will see how mechanical energy can be converted to electrical energy. Electrical generators have a key role in our technology driven society.

- back EMF, transformer, ground, inductance, RLC

## 23.1 Induced Emf and Magnetic Flux

### To Do

- Calculate the flux of a uniform magnetic field through a loop of arbitrary orientation.
- Describe methods to produce an electromotive force (emf) with a magnetic field or magnet and a loop of wire.

### Notes

Q1. In Figure 23.3 what situation leads to the induction of a current in the circuit that includes the galvanometer?

Q2. TRUE or FALSE  Electrons in the circuit that includes the battery move to the wire of the circuit that includes the galvanometer.

A permanent magnet can be the source of the magnetic field as well as the electromagnet shown in Figure 23.3. When the magnet moves towards or away from the coil, the strength of the magnetic field at the coil changes and a current is detected.

Magnetic Flux

There is more to generating current than just changing the value of B. The orientation of the area of the loop to the direction of B is important. This is evaluated by calculating the magnetic flux.

Φ = BA cos θ     A is the area of the loop of wire. Θ is the angle between the direction of B and the line that is perpendicular to the area.

Q3. List three conditions that produce zero magnetic flux.

## 23.2 Faraday&#39;s Law of Induction: Lenz&#39;s Law

### To Do

- Calculate emf, current, and magnetic fields using Faraday&#39;s Law.
- Explain the physical results of Lenz&#39;s Law

### Notes

Faraday determined that the induced EMF was proportional to the total change of magnetic flux and inversely proportional to the time required for the change to take place.

Faraday&#39;s Law  EMF = -N ΔΦB /(Δt)      N is the number of turns of wire in the coil

The minus sign is not important when you calculate the EMF. The minus sign reminds you to use Lenz&#39;s Law to find the direction of the induced current. This is explained below.

Know Lenz&#39;s Law:  The direction of the induced (conventional) current is such as to oppose the change that is taking place.

Know how to find the direction of induced current. This will involve

1. knowing the direction of the magnetic field
2. knowing if the magnetic flux is increasing or decreasing
3. trial and error in guessing the direction of the induced current and use of the right hand rule

Applications of Electromagnetic Induction

How does the principle of induced EMF apply to the dark strip on the back of a credit card?

You should read about the other applications of induced EMF. You are not responsible for the details of these applications. Just know that a change in magnetic flux induces an EMF.

We will use Faraday&#39;s Law to calculate the EMF (volts) for a variety of situations.

## 23.3 Motional Emf

### To Do

- Calculate emf, force, magnetic field, and work due to the motion of an object in a magnetic field.

### Notes

The first discussion in this section deals with situations in which the magnetic field is stationary. Motion is used to change the area of the coil.

Know how to find the value of EMF and current (magnitude and direction) for a rod moving on a set of rails that form a closed circuit.

An EMF is also generated when the magnetic field moves across the area of the coil.

## 23.4 Eddy Currents and Magnetic Damping

### To Do

- Explain the magnitude and direction of an induced eddy current, and the effect this will have on the object it is induced in.
- Describe several applications of magnetic damping.

### Notes

We may see a demonstration of magnetic damping that uses a pendulum made of aluminum and a powerful horseshoe magnet.

Eddy currents, and the magnetic damping, are reduced if the resistance of the material is higher or the conductor has narrow strips that allow small current loops that have opposing directions.

Applications of Magnetic Damping

Do you agree that magnetic damping can be used to bring a double pan balance to its final position in a short amount of time?

Q4. How is magnetic damping able to separate aluminum from paper at a recycling plant?  Aluminum is not a ferromagnetic material.

You should read the descriptions of metal detectors and magnetic braking.

## 23.5 Electric Generators

### To Do

- Calculate the emf induced in a generator.
- Calculate the peak emf which can be induced in a particular generator system.

### Notes

A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The mechanical energy may be provided by fission of uranium, burning of coal or oil, wind, or water.

Why is there an induced EMF when the coil in a generator turns?

Q5. TRUE or FALSE  A changing magnetic flux will produce an electric field.

Faraday&#39;s Law  EMF = -N ΔΦB /(Δt)   We can use Faraday&#39;s Law to find the average EMF produced in a generator. You should read the example in the textbook.

To find the EMF at any instant of time we use     EMF = N B A ω sin(ωt)     ω = 2πf

f is the frequency of the rotation of the generator in cycles per second (rotations per second).

ω is the angular velocity in radians/second. t is the time in seconds.

How can the value of the EMF be increased?

What is the difference in the construction of an AC and a DC generator?  Note that the DC generator does not deliver a constant EMF, but the EMF is always in the same direction.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. There must be a change in the magnetic field in the coil around the iron ring to induce a current in the coil of the circuit that includes the galvanometer. When the switch is open the current is zero. When the switch is closed there is a change in the value of current in the coil. If the current has a steady value there is no current in the circuit that contains the galvanometer. When the switch is opened the galvanometer will register a current.

Q2. False. The circuits are separate. The energy is transferred by the magnetic field created by the coil. There is energy transfer to the coil that is in the circuit with the galvanometer only when the magnetic field is changing.

Q3. B = 0 ;   A = 0;     θ = 90 or 270 degrees    At these angles the magnetic field lines are parallel to the surface of the coil, no magnetic field line passes through the coil.

Q4. The magnetic field at the recycling plant is not picking up the metal. The magnetic field creates eddy currents in the metal that affect the motion of the metal. Since metals (i.e. aluminum) are conductors this technique works for all metals that are moving past the magnet. The induced current in the metal can generate a magnetic field that is repelled by the magnetic field under the conveyor belt. This can toss the metal off of the conveyor belt.

Q5. TRUE   EMF establishes a potential difference    E =  EMF/distance

## 23.6 Back Emf

### To Do

- Explain what back EMF is and how it is induced.
- Calculate power in a motor with and without back EMF

### Notes

Q1. Where is back (counter) EMF found and what is its cause?

TRUE or FALSE   Back EMF reduces the current in a motor.

Why do the lights in some kitchens dim when the refrigerator motor starts?

Be able to do calculations of I and Power for electric motors when the back EMF is 0 and when there is a given value of back EMF. The basic technique is to subtract the EMF&#39;s and then calculate I.

Q2. Why is it dangerous for the bearings to fail on an electric motor?

## 23.7 Transformers

### To Do

- Explain how a transformer works.
- Calculate voltage, current, and/or number of turns given the other quantities.

### Notes

Semiconductors (transistors, integrated circuits, computers, etc.) often are used in circuits that have about 5 volts of potential difference. You cannot connect an integrated circuit or recharge a flashlight battery by connecting it directly to the 120 volt (rms) wall outlet. There are two reasons for this. 1) The wall outlet is AC and DC is needed to recharge a battery or run a semiconductor, and 2) 120 volts would destroy a device that is designed to operate at 5 volts.

Transformers provide part of the solution to the problem stated above. Transformers change the voltage (and current) from one circuit to another circuit. We will not discuss the solution to the problem of AC vs. DC. If this interests you do a search for DC power supply or rectifier.

The &quot;brick&quot; power supply for a computer or other small electronic device has a transformer and other electronic components to change the 120 volt AC power from the wall outlet to DC with a voltage of 5 volts, or 12 volts, etc.

How do transformers help to reduce the waste of energy in the distribution of electrical power in the USA from the power plant to the consumer?  The textbook has a nice drawing but does not specifically say why there is less power loss in the transmission lines when high voltage is used. You should write an explanation for the reduction in power loss in more detail than just saying &quot;less current&quot; or &quot;less line loss.&quot;  Remember that power loss in a wire is related to the square of the value of the current in the wire. P = I2R

You should be able to explain the meanings of &quot;primary coil&quot; and &quot;secondary coil.&quot;

Q3. How is a transformer constructed and how is electrical power transferred to the secondary coil?

VS = VP NS  /NP

Q4. Why do transformers not work with DC?

Almost all of the power in the primary coil is available to the secondary coil:  IP VP  about =  IS  VS

You should know the meaning of &quot;step-up&quot; and &quot;step-down.&quot;

Eddy currents in a transformer lead to electrical energy being lost due to heating of the iron of the transformer by the eddy currents. How are eddy currents minimized in a transformer?

## 23.8 Electrical Safety: Systems and Devices

### To Do

- Explain why a three-wire connection can provide protection to users of electrical equipment

### Notes

You should read through this material. You should know why a three-prong plug (and wiring) has safety advantages.

## 23.9 Inductance 23.10 RL Circuits  23.11 Reactance, Inductive and Capacitive

### To Do

- Explain why inductors interact with AC signals

### Notes

Inductors are coils of wire with perhaps an iron core to concentrate the magnetic field. An inductor will store energy in its magnetic field and oppose changes in current in an AC circuit. A circuit that contains an inductor has more resistance when the frequency of the AC increases.

You should know why an inductor interacts with an AC signal.

## 23.10 RL Circuits

### To Do

- skip

## 23.11 Reactance, Inductive and Capacitive

### To Do

- skip.

## 23.12 Reactance, Inductive and Capacitive

### To Do

- Explain why the RLC circuit has a minimum resistance at a certain frequency

### Notes

When a resistor, capacitor, and inductor are placed in series they have an interesting behavior as the frequency of the AC changes. Capacitors act as large resistors for low frequency currents. Inductors act as large resistors for high frequency currents. At some intermediate frequency the overall resistance of the RLC circuit is a minimum. This can be used to let a certain frequency move through the circuit while blocking signals that have high or low frequency. You should know why the RLC circuit has a minimum resistance at a certain frequency.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. It is found in motors. Motors are also generators while they are spinning. Following Lenz&#39;s Law, the induced EMF of the spinning motor opposes the applied voltage to the motor.

Q2. If the bearings fail the motor stops rotating and the back EMF goes to 0. This leads to a great increase in the current in the winding of the motor and an even greater increase in the power delivered to the windings of the motor (I2 R). If you are every near a motor that stops spinning, for some reason other than the power being turned off, you should unplug that motor immediately.

Q3. A transformer has a two coils of wire and an iron core. The coils of wire are parts of separate electrical circuits. AC electrical power in the primary coil produces a changing magnetic field in the iron. The changing magnetic field of the first coil is guided to the second coil by the iron. The changing magnetic field in the second coil results in changing magnetic flux and thus an induced current in the second circuit. The electrical power is transferred to the secondary coil by means of the magnetic field as long as the magnetic field is variable.

Q4. DC (direct current) typically has a constant voltage and current. If DC is applied to the primary coil a magnetic field will be established in the iron core of the transformer, but it will be a constant magnetic field. Only a changing magnetic field can induce a current in the secondary coil.
