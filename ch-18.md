## Ch 18: Electric Charge and Electric Field

### Introduction

We discussed the fundamental force of gravity during the first semester. This semester will start with a discussion of electromagnetism and the forces of electricity and magnetism. This chapter will discuss situations in which the charges are at rest. When charges move we have an electrical current. This will be covered in a future chapter.

### Terms to Know

* charge, static electricity, conductor, insulator, polarization, proton, electron
* field, polar, screening
* electrostatics, net field, perpendicular

### 18.1. Static Electricity and Charge: Conservation of Charge

#### To Do

* Define electric charge, and describe how the two types of charge interact.
* Describe three common situations that generate static electricity.
* State the law of conservation of charge.

#### Notes

Don't try to repeat Franklin's experiments with kites!

What situations are studied in electrostatics?

List some situations in which you have observed the force of static electricity.

What is electric charge?

How many types of charge exist?

Do charges create any other force other than attractive or repulsive?

We will see some demonstrations of force on charged objects in class. A charged rubber rod will have a net negative charge. A charged glass rod will have a net positive charge. In the 1700's the terms positive and negative were selected by scientists \(especially Franklin\). The terms positive and negative could have been chosen differently, which would have caused all the references to positive and negative to be reversed in all the textbooks written since the 1700's. The point is that we cannot see some label on the charged objects that tells us it is positive or negative. These terms are assigned as part of the scientific method of making observations and classifying objects before making a hypothesis that explains the observation.

Ask me to explain Franklin's view of electricity if I forget to explain it in class

If the amount of charge is fixed, what will cause the electric force to be weaker?

It was not until the early 1900's that scientists came to understand that objects are made of atoms and that the atoms have protons \(+\) and electrons \(-\).

Know the basic structure of the atom: proton, neutron, electron; small, dense, nuclear model.

What is the fundamental unit of charge?

Think about these questions

* Who determined the amount of charge on the electron?
* When was this determined?
* Where did this person attend high school?

Would you say that the Coulomb represents a large amount of charge?

Know the principle of "conservation of charge."

### 18.2 Conductors and Insulators

#### To Do

* Define conductor and insulator, explain the difference, and give examples of each.
* Describe three methods for charging an object.
* Explain what happens to an electric force as you move farther from the source.
* Define polarization.

#### Notes

Why does a metal conduct electricity?

Why does an insulator not conduct electricity?

How does an electroscope detect the presence of net charge?

Know the principles of charging by friction, contact and induction.

### 18.3 Coulomb's Law

#### To Do

* State Coulomb's law in terms of how the electrostatic force changes with the distance between two objects.
* Calculate the electrostatic force between two charged point forces, such as electrons or protons.
* Compare the electrostatic force to the gravitational attraction for a proton and an electron; for a human and the Earth.

#### Notes

How was the dependence of Force on amount of charge and distance between the objects determined? Who determined it?

Coulomb's law:

$$
F=k\frac{\left|q_1\right|\left|q_2\right|}{r^2}
$$

Compare the mathematical form of Coulomb's Law to Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation.

Would you say that gravity or the electrical force is more important in calculating the acceleration of a proton and electron that are near each other? \($$\overrightarrow{F}=m\overrightarrow{a}$$ \)

Why did we bother discussing the force of gravity during the first semester if gravity is so weak compared to the electrical force?

We may work example problems using Coulomb's Law.

Know how to add force vectors.

### 18.4. Electric Field: Concept of a Field Revisited

#### To Do

* Describe a force field and calculate the strength of an electric field due to a point charge.
* Calculate the force exerted on a test charge by an electric field.
* Explain the relationship between electrical force \(F\) on a test charge and electrical field strength \(E\).

#### Notes

You may recall that we calculated weight during the first semester using $$W=mg$$.

The acceleration due to gravity, $$g$$, is being used as a field in this calculation. Sometimes, we will calculate electric force using the concept of an electric field. g is not quite as interesting as the electric field as g always pointed towards the center of the Earth. The electric field will have more variety to its direction.

A test charge is a very small charge that does not disturb any other existing charges in the situation. If you divide the observed electric force by the value of a test charge at a point in space you will have found the electric field. The magnitude of the field \(Newtons/Coulomb\) is given by the division of the numbers. The direction of the field is the direction of the force, assuming your test charge carries positive charge. The direction of the field is 180 degrees different if the test charge is negative.

Electric Field Due to a Point Charge:

$$
F=k\frac{\left|q\right|}{r^2}
$$

We may do some sample calculations of the electric field and electric force.

Know how to draw electric field lines and know what they signify \(magnitude of E and direction\).

### 18.5 Electric Field Lines: Multiple Charges

#### To Do

* Calculate the total force \(magnitude and direction\) exerted on a test charge from more than one charge
* Describe an electric field diagram of a positive point charge; of a negative point charge with twice the magnitude of positive charge
* Draw the electric field lines between two points of the same charge; between two points of opposite charge.

#### Notes

What questions do you have on the sketch of electric field lines for a single charge?

Do you agree that the spacing of the lines is an indicator of the magnitude of the electric field?

The electric field is a vector. When there is more than one charge present you will have to find the net electric field by performing vector addition E fields using the component method.

We will also do vector addition with electric force vectors.

You should memorize the rules for electric fields that are given after Figure 18.26.

I would recommend that you run the PhET electric field simulation.

### 18.6 Electric Forces in Biology

#### To Do

* Describe how a water molecule is polar.
* Explain electrostatic screening by a water molecule within a living cell.

#### Notes

You should read through this section to increase your appreciation for the role electrical forces play in Biology.

The term screening will come up again when we study the atom. Suppose three protons are located at the origin of a coordinate system. Suppose two electrons are located at location X = 2 meters. Suppose a third electron is located at X = 3 meters. The three protons will be partially screened by the two electrons such that the electron at X = 3 meters will essentially experience force from one proton. The details are a little more complicated than this, but the term screening refers to a partial reduction in the electric effect due to intervening charges.

Water is a polar molecule. The charges are not uniformly distributed in the water molecule. One end of the molecule is more negative that the other end of the molecule. If I remember I will illustrate this in class.

### 18.7 Conductors and Electric Fields in Static Equilibrium

#### To Do

* List the three properties of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.
* Explain the effect of an electric field on free charges in a conductor.
* Explain why no electric field may exist inside a conductor.
* Describe the electric field surrounding Earth.
* Explain what happens to an electric field applied to an irregular conductor.
* Describe how a lightning rod works.
* Explain how a metal car may protect passengers inside from the dangerous electric fields caused by a downed line touching the car.

#### Notes

Conductors roughly have one free electron for each atom in the conductor. There is an extremely large number of electrons that can move in a typical conductor. These electrons \(and any additional electrons added to the conductor\) quickly \( less than a billionth of a second\) move to establish static equilibrium if they are ever out of equilibrium. After this short time the charges are not moving and are not accelerating.

What is true about the net force on an object that is not accelerating?

For a conductor in static electricity, why does the component of the electric field that is parallel to the conductor have a value of 0 N/C?

For the case of electrostatics, when a neutral conductor is placed in an external electric field, the charges in the conductor move briefly to an arrangement such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This has been known since the late 1700's. In Figure 18.31 imagine the electric field before the conductor is inserted into the electric field. The electric field lines would be parallel lines directed to the right. Imagine the instant in time when the conductor is inserted. The electric field lines would be parallel lines in the conductor. How do the charges have to move in the conductor to produce a net electric field of zero? To produce a zero net electric field a second electric field directed to the left needs to be in place. This accomplished by electrons in the conductor moving to the left. The second electric field due to charge separation \(polarization\) in the conductor will cancel the original electric field inside the conductor. Ask me in class if this explanation is not clear.

Note that excess charge will reside on the surface of a conductor for the case of static electricity. This has been confirmed experimentally. The excess charges repel each other. The charges can move in a conductor. The charges move to the surface around the object to establish equilibrium.

From the previous discussion you should be able to answer these questions.

1. What is true concerning the value of the electric field inside a conductor \(for electrostatics\)?
2. Where does excess charge reside on a metal object \(for electrostatics\)?
3. How is an electric field line drawn at the surface of a conductor \(for electrostatics\)?

For a single charge the electric field lines diverge from the location of the charge. Figure 18.33 shows how a uniform electric field can be produced. We will ignore the curved field lines at the left and right edge of the sketch. Describe how the sketch indicates that the electric field is uniform between the two lines of charge.

Sunlight can ionize atoms at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. Some of the electrons from these atoms can escape into space. What is the net charge of the ionosphere?

The Earth is a conductor. Electrons in the Earth can migrate to the surface of the Earth to try to get nearer to the ionosphere. Does this lead to an electric field \(150 N/C\) in the atmosphere of the Earth?

Large air currents in thunderstorms can cause a separation of charge. When the electric field gets large enough \(3 x 106 N/C\) the atoms in the atmosphere ionize and lightning occurs.

You should know that the strongest electric field occurs at the sharp points of a conductor. A lightning rod is not used to draw a lightning bolt, but rather to reduce the net charge in the vicinity of the building to reduce the electric field and make a lightning strike less likely.

Describe the excess charges and electric field in a Faraday cage.

### 18.8 Applications of Electrostatics

#### To Do

* ?

#### Notes

Van de Graaff Generator

This device has a large smooth conductor at the top. An insulating belt has electrons removed at the bottom. The belt removes electrons at the top of the device. A large positive charge is developed on the top dome of the device. We will learn in a future chapter that this develops a large potential \(voltage\) on the top dome. Positive ions released near this dome can be accelerated as their potential energy near the dome changes to kinetic energy.

You should read through the other examples of electrostatics \(photocopier, laser printer, pollution control\) in this section.
