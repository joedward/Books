## S 01\_Dimensions and Units

### “Things” We Measure

A dimension is a “type of thing” that can be measured. Length, for instance, is a dimension. Other dimensions include the following:

Area

Volume

Time

Mass

Weight \(or Force\)

Temperature

Each dimension is measured with an appropriate unit.

While length is a dimension, some units that are used to measure length include the following:

Inch

Foot

Yard

Mile

Meter

The International System of Units is a collection of standardized units. \(This is essentially the metric system.\)

Note. SI = System International.

The SI units were preceded by the following:

MKS System \(meter, kilogram, second – favored by physicists\)

CGS System \(centimeter, gram, second – favored by chemists\)

Some dimensions and sample units are provided in the table below.

Note: A double asterisk indicates the official SI unit, and a single asterisk indicates a metric unit \(but not the official SI unit\).

| Dimension | Sample Units |
| :--- | :--- |
| Length | Inch, Foot, Yard, Mile, \*\*Meter |
| Area | Inch², Acre, \*Hectare, \*\*Meter² |
| Volume | Foot³, Teaspoon, Tablespoon, Fluid Ounce, Cup, Pint, Quart, Gallon, \*Liter, \*\*Meter³ |
| Time | \*\*Second, Minute, Hour, Day, Week, Month, Year, Decade, Century, Millennium |
| Mass | Slug, \*Gram, \*\*Kilogram |
| Force \(including Weight\) | Ounce, Pound, \*\*Newton |
| Temperature | Fahrenheit, \*Celsius, \*\*Kelvin |

### Convenience

When measuring and communicating, “convenient” units are useful.

For instance, lengths of small objects might be measured in inches rather than miles.

To achieve the same effect, the SI system employs metric prefixes to create units appropriate for what’s being measured.

Short lengths might be measured in centimeters.

Long distances might be measured in kilometers.

## S 02\_Dimensional Analysis

As noted, a dimension can be measured using a variety of units. Sometimes, however, it is useful to not worry about particular units and to instead use “generic” units \(which can be called the dimension\). A short list of common dimensions follows:

| Dimension | Symbol |
| :--- | :--- |
| Length | L |
| Mass | M |
| Time | T |

### Examples of Basic and Derived Dimensions

| Quantity | Commonly Used Symbol | Dimension |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| position | x | L |
| time | t | T |
| mass | m | M |
| velocity | v | L/T |
| acceleration | a | L/T2 |
| weight \(or force\) | W \(or F\) | M⋅L/T2 |

\[A\] means “the dimension of A.”

So if x is a length, then x=L.

### Dimensional Consistency

For an equation to be dimensionally consistent, each side of the equation must have the same dimension. If this were not so, then you might find a length on the left side of an equation and a volume on the right side, which would just be nonsense. \(It would be like claiming 3 feet=7 gallons, and then people might look at you strangely.\)

Notice that the numbers really don’t matter in dimensional consistency. The numbers may be vitally important, but they don’t contribute to the idea of dimensional consistency.

Then, using dimensions \(or generic units\) 8 L=3 L is dimensionally consistent, but 8 L=4 M is not. \(Could a length equal a mass?\)

Similarly, using derived dimensions, 7 L/T2=9 L/T2 is dimensionally consistent, but 7 L/T=9 L/T2 is not. \(The dimensions on each side must match perfectly.\)

Consider the equation x=3at2. To see that it is dimensionally consistent, replace each quantity that has a dimension with its dimension, and then use algebra to simplify, as follows…

x=3at2 x=3at2 L=3⋅LT2⋅T2 L=3L

But the equation x=3at is not dimensionally consistent, as seen below…

x=3at x=3at L=3⋅LT2⋅T L=3LT

### The Importance of Dimensional Consistency

Dimensional consistency can be thought of as a first test in verifying an equation. If the equation fails this first test, then it can’t be a correct equation.

The second test might be to use the equation to work out results \(including the numeric values\), and comparing the results to experimental data. If the results match, then the equation may well be the correct equation.

For a final emphasis, consider that any equation that is NOT dimensionally consistent MUST be WRONG.

## S 03\_Uncertainty in Measurement and Significant Figures

### Significant Figures

### Accuracy and Precision

The rule-of-thumb for this class is as follows:

Keep all decimal places in a calculation and only round the result for the final answer. For the final answer, keep four significant figures.

\(If it is helpful, write the final answer in scientific notation, and then round to three decimal places.\)

In practice \(in the real world\), the way in which a final result should be rounded depends on the details of the problem being solved.

### Examples Showing Four Significant Figures

| Calculator | Rounded\(4 Significant Digits\) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1.02938745 | 1.029 |
| 0.000941672 =9.41672×10-4 | 9.417×10-4 =0.0009417 |
| 294628738 =2.94628738×108 | 2.946×108 =294600000 |

## S 04\_Unit Conversions

### Conversion of Units

A conversion factor can used to change a quantity from one unit to another.

### Common Unit Abbreviations

| mile=mi | hour=h |
| :--- | :--- |
| kilometer=km | mile=mi |
| ounce=oz |  |

### Sample Conversion “Factors”

| 1 mi=5280 ft | 1 h=3600 s |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 km=1000 m | 1 mi=1609 m |
| 1 cup=8 oz |  |

Many other conversion factors are listed in the textbook or can be found online.

### The Truth About Conversion Factors

The “true” conversion factor is always the number 1 written as a ratio connecting the units. For instance,

1=5280 ft1 mi

### Cross-Cancellation Method

A quantity can be changed from one unit to another by multiplying by the appropriate conversion factor.

Multiplying by the conversion factor does NOT change the actual value of the quantity, but it does change the appearance of the quantity \(both the numeric part and the unit part\).

### Word-Problem Method

Sometimes treating the conversion like a word problem can be useful.

### Substitution Method

This method is particularly useful when expressions get complicated.

## S 05\_Coordinate Systems

In 1-D, the number line is sufficient for many purposes.

| Absolute position \(rectangular coordinate\) | Relative position \(distance and direction\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| x=4 m | 4 m  to the right of the origin |

### 2-D

Algebra often emphasize rectangular coordinates. Such coordinates tend to be “easy” to use when solving problems.

Related Names: Rectangular Coordinate System, Cartesian Coordinate System, or \(simply\) Coordinates

However, people tend to communicate using polar coordinates \(or at least distance and direction\).

Related Names: Polar Coordinate System, Distance and Direction

### Rectangular vs Polar

For practical reasons, both types of coordinate systems are needed. There are no winners.

We often communicate using polar-like information, but math is often more easily done using rectangular-like information. It is common for problems to be presented in polar coordinates, which are then converted into rectangular coordinates where the problem is then solved, and then the answer is converted back into polar coordinates.

This process makes use of trigonometry.

**Objectives**

“Solve” triangles using the Pythagorean Theorem, the Angle-Sum Theorem, and the Trigonometric sine, cosine, and tangent functions \(and their inverses\).

## S 06\_Right-Triangle Trigonometry

There are two common approaches to trigonometry:

Right-Triangle Trigonometry

Rotational \(or Unit-Circle\) Trigonometry

This section highlights Right-Triangle Trigonometry, but later sections will emphasize Rotational Trigonometry.

A triangle has has six simple and measurable parts: three sides, and three angles.

### Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean Theorem relates the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle.

a2+b2=c2

leg2+leg2=hyp2

### Angle-Sum Theorem

The Angle Sum Theorem relates the measures of the three angles of a triangle.

A+B+C=180°

### Trigonometry

Trigonometry interrelates the side lengths and angle measures.

Six trigonometric functions are commonly defined:

sine = sin

cosine = cos

tangent = tan

cotangent = cot

secant = sec

cosecant = csc

But three of the functions are most frequently used:

sin, cos, tan

Note: There are also other, more obscure trig functions, but only two \(such as sin and cos\) are really needed.

### Trigonometric Ratios, Defined

The cosine, sine, and tangent trigonometric ratios are defined as follows:

cosθ=ac or cosθ=adjhyp

sinθ=bc or sinθ=opphyp

tanθ=ba or tanθ=oppadj

### A Few Trig Identities

tanθ=sinθcosθ

sinθ2+cosθ2=1

sin2θ+cos2θ=1

### Inverse Trig Functions

For a first look, trig functions can be “undone” using the inverse trig functions \(or “arc” functions\).

There are several common ways to write the inverse functions, including the following:

arccosθ or acosθ or cos-1θ

arcsinθ or asinθ or sin-1θ

arctanθ or atanθ or tan-1θ

For instance, if

tanθ= x

then

tan-1tanθ=tan-1 x θ=tan-1 x

## Example 03\_

Convert 167 cm3 to m3.

## Solution

Note that

1 m=100 cm 1 m3=100 cm3 13 m3=1003 cm3 1 m3=1003 cm3

Then

167 cm3=167 cm31 =167 cm31⋅1 =167 cm31⋅1 m31003 cm3 =167 m31003 =0.000167 m3

If you think of converting from centimeters to meters as meaning the decimal should be moved two places to the left, then the “cubed” means to do this three times.

## Example 04\_

## Solution

This problem can be done conveniently by the cross-cancellation method, changing first to meters and then to nanometers.

## Example 05\_Algebra Method
